Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
In the unified multi-step form, Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 currently show “alert” style helper content that explains why that step is important (why the user is being asked these questions / why it matters). These alerts are visible but easy to skim past and don’t visually stand out from other helper text. I want to visually upgrade these alerts into prominent, friendly “Why this step matters” banners that are always visible, sit near the top of the step (under the step title/description), and use Reframe.me’s brand colors to gently draw attention. There should be no user interaction required to see the content (no hover, no click to expand).

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Do not make any code changes yet. First, assess the current implementation, describe your understanding, identify key considerations, and propose a step-by-step plan. Wait for my explicit approval before editing any files.

Business requirement – Make “Why this step matters” alerts visually prominent banners on Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

Current behavior

The unified multi-step form has multiple steps; specifically, Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 each contain an “alert-like” text block explaining why that step is important.

These alerts:

Are already visible on the step (not hidden behind tooltips).

Use relatively subtle styling (likely similar to generic helper/error/info blocks).

Do not strongly stand out from the rest of the form content.

Users can easily skim past them or not realize they’re important coaching content, not just generic filler.

Desired behavior

For Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9:

Transform the existing alert blocks into full-width, always-visible “Why this step matters” banners that:

Sit near the top of the step, directly below the step title and description and above the form fields.

Use updated styling to make them visually distinct and important.

The banners should:

Be non-dismissible and always visible (no hover, no click to reveal).

Include:

A small icon (e.g., an exclamation, star, or lightbulb) to draw the eye.

A short, bold heading: e.g., “Why this step matters”.

The existing explanatory text for that step (content specific to that step), shown directly under the heading.

Use a friendly, alert-like visual style:

A soft orange-tinted background to signal importance.

An orange left border to “flag” the section.

Teal text for the heading to align with Reframe.me branding.

Dark neutral text for the body for readability.

These changes are visual only:

The copy/content of each alert stays the same (unless minor tweaks are needed for heading text like “Why this step matters”).

The form structure, inputs, and validation do not change.

Steps other than 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 should not suddenly gain this banner; only steps that already have these “this step is important” alerts should be affected.

Constraints

Keep the alerts:

Always visible.

Not interactive (no expand/collapse).

Do not change:

The emotional check-in line behavior.

Step ordering or navigation.

Any business logic, validation, or backend behavior.

Keep tone and visuals trauma-aware:

Important and noticeable, but not shouting or alarming.

Respect mobile-first design:

Banners must look good and be legible on small screens.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Step 2 shows a prominent “Why this step matters” banner

Given the user navigates to Step 2 of the unified multi-step form

When the step renders

Then directly under the step’s main heading/description, there should be a full-width banner that:

Has a soft orange-tinted background and an orange left border.

Shows an icon plus the heading text “Why this step matters” (or equivalent) in teal, bold text.

Shows the existing explanatory text for Step 2 beneath the heading, in neutral readable text.

And the banner should be visible without any user interaction.

Scenario: Steps 4, 7, 8, 9 also show the new banner style

Given the user navigates to Step 4, 7, 8, or 9

When any of these steps render

Then each step should show the same style of “Why this step matters” banner (color, layout, heading/icon style) under its own step heading

And the content inside each banner should be that step’s existing explanation of why the step is important.

Scenario: Other steps are unaffected

Given the user navigates to steps that do not currently have these “this step is important” alerts (e.g., Step 1, Step 3, etc.)

When those steps render

Then they should not show the new orange “Why this step matters” banner

And any existing helper text on those steps should remain unchanged.

Scenario: Banner is always visible and non-interactive

Given the user is on any of Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

When they scroll within the step content

Then the “Why this step matters” banner should be visible at the top of the step content area (unless scrolled off-screen naturally)

And there should be no hover or click needed to view the content inside the banner.

Scenario: Layout remains mobile-friendly and readable

Given the user is on a small viewport (mobile)

When they view Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9

Then the banner should:

Fit nicely within the width (no horizontal scroll).

Maintain legible font sizes.

Not push the rest of the form content so far down that it becomes unusable on mobile.

Scenario: No regression in form behavior

Given the user navigates through the form steps, going Back and Next, filling fields, and seeing validation errors

When they interact with these steps

Then:

All existing fields, validations, Next/Back navigation, progress bar, and emotional check-in behavior should remain unchanged.

Only the visual appearance of the “why this matters” content should differ from before.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do
1. Assess the current implementation

Locate the components that render Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, and 9 in the unified multi-step form:

This might be individual components (e.g., Step2ProgramsAndSkills, Step4Ownership, etc.) or a single form step component with configuration.

Identify:

Where the current “this step is important” alert content lives in each step:

Is it inline JSX in each step?

Is it a shared component (e.g., <Alert />) with different messages?

Is there a specific class name / structure used for these blocks?

Check:

Whether there is already a shared alert or info component that could be reused or extended.

How the alert is positioned relative to:

The step title/description.

The form fields.

2. Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain that you will:

Create or reuse a shared React component (e.g., <StepImportanceAlert />) that:

Accepts the step-specific explanatory text as children or props.

Renders a full-width, always-visible “Why this step matters” banner under the step title.

Uses updated Tailwind styling (rounded, border-l-4, orange background tint, teal heading, icon).

Replace or wrap the existing alert content on Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 with this component.

Ensure all other steps remain unchanged.

3. Identify key considerations / risks

Consistency across steps

All five steps should use the same visual pattern for the banner (same classes/icon/layout).

Content and tone

Existing text should remain intact; only heading and wrapper styling change.

Heading text should feel supportive and not alarming.

Accessibility

Ensure:

The heading is semantically appropriate (e.g., <p> with font-semibold or an <h3> with correct hierarchy).

Icon is either decorative (aria-hidden="true") or has appropriate ARIA label.

Mobile layout

The banner must not overflow horizontally.

Text must wrap gracefully on small screens.

No interactive complexity

No toggle/expand logic; keep this a simple static component.

4. Propose best-practice implementation details

Create a dedicated component, e.g. StepImportanceAlert.jsx, that:

Accepts props like:

title (defaulting to "Why this step matters").

children or body for the step-specific copy.

Uses Tailwind classes to create the desired visual style, for example:

Outer container:

mt-4 rounded-xl border border-orange-200 border-l-4 border-l-orange-400 bg-orange-50/80 px-4 py-3 text-sm

Header row:

flex items-center gap-2 text-teal-900 font-semibold

Icon: small, teal, e.g., a circle with ! or a simple inline SVG.

Body text:

mt-1 text-slate-800 text-sm leading-relaxed

Insert <StepImportanceAlert> into Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9:

Immediately below the step’s main title and description.

Pass the existing explanatory copy into this component.

Keep the content of each alert short and readable; if any alert was very long, consider minor formatting (line breaks) without changing the message.

5. Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

Provide a concrete implementation plan, such as:

Identify steps and existing alert content

Open the component(s) for Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9.

Find the JSX where the current “this step matters” alerts are rendered.

Note whether they share any existing CSS/utility classes.

Create StepImportanceAlert component

In src/components/forms (or similar), create a new file, e.g., StepImportanceAlert.jsx.

Implement the component with:

A heading row with icon + “Why this step matters”.

A body area for explanatory text.

Tailwind classes for a soft orange banner with an orange left border and teal heading.

Make the icon decorative (aria-hidden="true") unless you explicitly add accessible text.

Wire StepImportanceAlert into Step 2

Import StepImportanceAlert into the Step 2 component.

Replace the existing alert markup with <StepImportanceAlert> and pass the existing text as children.

Ensure it appears under the step title and above the fields.

Repeat for Steps 4, 7, 8, 9

For each step:

Import StepImportanceAlert.

Wrap or replace the existing alert content with <StepImportanceAlert>.

Confirm the content remains step-specific but now uses the shared styling.

Check layout on mobile and desktop

Run the app locally, navigate to Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9:

Confirm the banner appears in the correct place.

Confirm there is no horizontal scrolling.

Confirm text is readable and does not overlap other elements.

Verify no regression

Check that other steps (without these alerts) did not gain the banner.

Confirm form navigation, validation, and emotional check-in remain unchanged.

Keep the scope limited

For this prompt, you must NOT:

Change step copy beyond minor heading text like “Why this step matters” in the banner component.

Modify validation logic, form data structure, or backend integration.

Alter the emotional check-in line, its text, or behavior.

Change the order or number of steps.

Introduce interactions (e.g., expand/collapse) for these banners.

Change other alert styles outside Steps 2, 4, 7, 8, 9 unless explicitly required to keep things consistent.

Skeleton framework / code snippet (required – example only)

Note: This is an illustrative example only. You must align it with the actual step components, state, and folder structure in the codebase before editing any files.

// src/components/StepImportanceAlert.jsx
import React from "react";

function StepImportanceAlert({ title = "Why this step matters", children }) {
  return (

      {/* New always-visible alert */}
      <StepImportanceAlert>
        {/* Use the existing Step 2 explanatory text here */}
        This part helps you name the programs and strengths you want employers to
        see. Taking a moment here can make it easier to talk about how you’ve
        grown and what you bring to a role.
      </StepImportanceAlert>

      {/* Existing form fields for Step 2 go here */}
      <section className="space-y-4">

      <StepImportanceAlert>
        This step can help you calmly explain why your past may or may not be
        relevant to the job. It gives employers context and helps you stay in
        control of how you tell your story.
      </StepImportanceAlert>
