You are my AI pair-programmer in Replit.
We are building a mobile-first web application for justice-involved individuals that:

Generates 5 disclosure narratives for employers

Generates a pre-adverse action response letter
based on a unified form and a simple 5-screen flow (Home → Selection → Multi-step form → Loading → Disclaimer + Documents).

Technology constraints (very important):

Use React in a single-page app.

Use JavaScript only (NOT TypeScript) – be explicit in all files.

Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Design is mobile-first, then progressively enhanced for tablet/desktop.

Business requirement – Scaffolding & Home Page

Create initial project scaffolding and a Home page that clearly explains the app’s purpose and funnels users into the main flow with a single CTA: “Let’s Get Started”. The Home page must feel calming, supportive, and low-anxiety for justice-involved job seekers.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)

Scenario: First-time user lands on home page

Given a new user opens the root URL on a mobile device

When the app loads

Then they see:

A clear value proposition explaining that the app helps generate interview narratives and a pre-adverse action response letter

Brief, plain-language descriptions of the two tools (narratives + response letter)

A single, primary CTA button labeled “Let’s Get Started” that navigates them to the Selection Page

Basic navigation/header (logo/title, optional “Learn more / Resources” links)

Scenario: CTA navigates to Selection Page

Given the user is on the Home page

When they tap “Let’s Get Started”

Then the app routes them to a placeholder Selection Page component (can initially just show “Selection Page coming next”).

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and determine what steps need to be taken to address the change.

Describe your understanding of the requirements for:

Project structure

Home page content and layout

Navigation to the Selection Page

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting future functionality, including:

Routing strategy for a single-page app

How the layout will support the later steps (Selection, Form, Loading, Disclaimer, Documents)

Propose a best-practice, mobile-first UX for this Home page that is calming and clear for justice-involved individuals.

Assess any other best practices that may be relevant, including accessibility (contrast, readable fonts, focus states) and Tailwind usage.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement, including:

Initial React + Tailwind setup in Replit (or aligning to existing setup)

File/folder structure you’ll use (e.g., src/pages/Home.jsx, src/components/Layout.jsx, etc.)

How routing / component switching will be handled

Do not make changes that will break other features (if any exist); keep the scope limited to:

Base scaffolding

Home page

Placeholder Selection page route/component

Propose how the technical changes will be made in a skeleton framework, for example:

Show the key React components and how they import each other

Show the Tailwind configuration and base layout wrapper

Important: Do not start editing files yet.

First, output your understanding, considerations, and implementation plan.

Stop and wait for my confirmation that your approach and understanding are sound before you touch any files.
