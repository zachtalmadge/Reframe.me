I want to add very gentle background motion to the hero area to make it feel alive without being distracting.

Important:
No e2e tests. Manual/component-level checks only.

Business requirement – Subtle animated hero background

Enhance the hero background so that:

Add a soft, animated radial gradient or “light spot”

Behind the hero content, add:

A radial gradient or soft “spotlight” that slowly moves or shifts over time.

Motion:

Very slow (e.g., 20–30 seconds per full cycle).

Small movement (a gentle drift, not big jumps).

Optional abstract shapes

Add 1–3 semi-transparent shapes (e.g., circles/blobs/rounded rects) in the background:

Slightly offset positions.

Very low opacity.

These shapes can:

Slowly move/parallax on scroll or gently oscillate with keyframes.

Always stay behind content (no overlap on text).

Performance and subtlety

Animations must:

Be implemented with lightweight CSS keyframes or transforms.

Not cause jank or heavy repaints.

Visual effect should be:

Calm and modern, not neon or aggressive.

Respect reduced motion

If prefers-reduced-motion is enabled:

Either stop the animation (static gradient) or heavily minimize it (very small changes or none).

Acceptance criteria
Scenario: Hero background feels gently alive

Given the user views the hero

When they look at it for a few seconds

Then:

They notice a subtle shifting of light/gradient and possibly soft shapes moving slowly.

The motion never competes with reading the headline/CTA.

Scenario: Performance remains smooth

Given the app runs on typical devices

When the background animation is active

Then:

Scrolling and interaction remain smooth.

No visible stuttering or lag due to the animation.

Scenario: Reduced motion users see static background

Given a user has prefers-reduced-motion: reduce

When they load the Home page

Then:

They see a stable, static hero background, or minimal motion only.

No long-running or distracting animations.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess current hero container

Find where the hero’s background is defined (probably a section with bg-* classes).

Describe your understanding

Confirm you’ll add a subtle animated gradient/spot and optional shapes behind the content using Tailwind + CSS keyframes or inline styles.

Key considerations

Ensure background layers do not interfere with text contrast.

Keep animation GPU-friendly (e.g., transform, opacity).

Implementation plan

Step 1: Wrap hero content in a relative container.

Step 2: Add one or more absolute background layers for radial gradient / shapes with low opacity.

Step 3: Define keyframes (in Tailwind config or a CSS file) for slow drift/oscillation.

Step 4: Use animate-[custom] or transition-transform classes to move shapes.

Step 5: Add a prefers-reduced-motion guard in Tailwind or CSS to disable animations for those users.

Skeleton

// Tailwind config: define keyframes like "float-slow"
// e.g., 0% { transform: translate3d(0,0,0); } 50% { transform: translate3d(10px, -10px,0);} 100% { ... }

function HeroBackground() {
  return (
    <section className="relative overflow-hidden">
      {/* animated background layers */}
      <div
        className="pointer-events-none absolute -left-10 top-0 h-64 w-64 rounded-full bg-orange-300/20 blur-3xl animate-[float-slow_25s_ease-in-out_infinite]"
        aria-hidden="true"
      />
      <div
        className="pointer-events-none absolute right-0 top-20 h-72 w-72 rounded-full bg-emerald-300/10 blur-3xl animate-[float-slow_30s_ease-in-out_infinite]"
        aria-hidden="true"
      />
      {/* hero content wrapper */}
      <div className="relative px-4 py-12">
        {/* existing hero content */}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
