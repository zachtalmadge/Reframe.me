Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The app uses a shared Button component (e.g., from @/components/ui/button) for CTAs like:

Get Started on the Home page

Continue / Next / Previous in the form

Add buttons (e.g., add another offense, add program/skill)

Any other primary/secondary buttons across the app

I want to add subtle, consistent microinteractions to all buttons that use this shared Button component, and keep the navbar logo sweep effect from the original prompt.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Global button motion + one-time navbar logo sweep

Implement the following enhancements:

Global button hover/focus behavior (applies to EVERY Button)

For all buttons rendered via the shared Button component (Get Started, Continue, Add, etc.):

On desktop hover and keyboard focus-visible:

The button should:

Slightly brighten or subtly adjust its background/gradient.

Have a smooth transform transition ready (even if some buttons don’t move icons).

Add:

transition-transform, transition-colors, and a short duration (around 150–200ms, ease-out).

Global button pressed/click behavior

For all buttons:

On click/press (mouse or touch), the button should show a quick press interaction:

Slight scale-95 (or similar) on active, then return to normal.

Optional slight shadow change to emphasize the press.

This must not interfere with existing click handlers (navigation, form submission, etc.).

Optional icon microinteraction (where icons are present)

Some buttons (like “Get Started” or “Continue” arrows) include icons, typically to the right of the text.

For buttons that include an icon wrapped in a dedicated span (e.g., <span className="button-icon">):

On hover/focus:

The icon should slide a few pixels to the right (translate-x-1) with a smooth transition.

This behavior should be opt-in / pattern-based:

Do not assume every button has an icon.

Only apply the slide animation when a span or element uses the appropriate classes (e.g., group-hover:translate-x-1).

Navbar logo – one-time light sweep on page load (unchanged in scope but keep it)

On the Home page only, when the page first loads:

The Reframe.me logo should have a single, subtle “light sweep” animation across it:

A semi-transparent white gradient or bar moves across the logo once (~600–800ms).

No looping.

Should:

Run only once per page load.

Be subtle and not distracting.

Tone and accessibility

All motion should:

Feel calm, modern, and consistent on every button.

Not be jarring or “gimmicky.”

Respect prefers-reduced-motion where reasonable:

If reduced motion is enabled, either remove the transform animations or reduce them to simple color changes.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Any button hover/focus animation

Given the user is anywhere in the app (Home, Selection, Form, Loading, Results, etc.)

When they hover over or focus any button that uses the shared Button component (e.g., Get Started, Continue, Add, Next, Previous)

Then:

The button’s background/gradient subtly brightens or adjusts.

The button has a smooth transform transition applied.

There is NO layout shift.

Scenario: Any button pressed/click state

Given the user is interacting with any button in the app

When they click or tap the button

Then:

The button briefly scales down (e.g., to 95%) and then returns to normal, creating a tactile press feel.

The existing click behavior (navigation, submit, etc.) still runs as before.

Scenario: Icon slide on buttons that have icons

Given a button includes an icon (e.g., an arrow in the Get Started/Continue buttons) and uses the designated icon span pattern

When the user hovers/focuses that button

Then:

The icon slides slightly to the right with a smooth animation.

When the pointer leaves / focus moves away, the icon returns to its resting position.

Scenario: Logo light sweep on initial Home load

Given the user navigates to the Home page (fresh load)

When the page renders for the first time

Then:

The Reframe.me logo performs a single, subtle light sweep animation.

The animation completes and does not loop until a new page load.

Scenario: Motion is respectful and accessible

Given a user has prefers-reduced-motion enabled

When they use the app

Then:

Button animations are reduced or disabled (e.g., only color change, no scale/slide), and

The core UX remains fully functional.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the shared Button component and logo implementation

Locate:

The shared Button component (e.g., @/components/ui/button).

The Home page component that uses the “Get Started” button.

The navbar / Layout component that renders the Reframe.me logo.

Confirm:

That most buttons across the app use this shared Button (Continue, Add, etc.).

How icons are typically included inside buttons (e.g., ArrowRight from lucide-react).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That all buttons using the shared Button component should share consistent hover/focus/pressed microinteractions.

That icon slide behavior is optional, applied where a button uses the icon span pattern.

That the logo still needs a one-time sweep on Home page load.

Identify key considerations to avoid breaking existing functionality

Ensure:

You don’t change button semantics (type="button" | "submit") or existing click handlers.

The new transforms do not cause unexpected layout reflows (use inline-flex properly).

Buttons remain visually consistent with the existing brand (colors, shapes, etc.).

Propose best-practice Tailwind implementation at the Button component level

In the shared Button component:

Add base classes like:

transition-transform transition-colors duration-150 ease-out

hover:brightness-110 focus-visible:brightness-110

active:scale-95

Make sure the component supports className composition so existing variant styles are preserved.

For optional icon microinteractions:

Encourage a pattern like:

<Button className="group">
  Label
  <span className="button-icon inline-flex items-center transition-transform duration-150 group-hover:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible:translate-x-1">
    <ArrowRight className="h-4 w-4" />
  </span>
</Button>


For prefers-reduced-motion:

Optionally implement a small hook or conditional that removes scale/translate classes when reduced motion is requested.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Update the shared Button component to include:

transition-transform, transition-colors, duration-150, ease-out.

hover:brightness-110 / focus-visible:brightness-110.

active:scale-95.

Step 2: Ensure all existing buttons (Get Started, Continue, Add, Retry, etc.) use this shared component.

Step 3: For buttons that should animate an icon (like Get Started, Continue):

Wrap the icon in a span and apply group + group-hover:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible:translate-x-1 classes.

Step 4: Implement or keep the navbar logo sweep from the previous prompt:

Add LogoWithSweep or similar component that triggers a one-time animation on Home mount.

Step 5: Optionally add reduced-motion handling so transforms are removed when prefers-reduced-motion is reduce.

Step 6: Manually test:

Hover/focus/click on several buttons across the app (Home CTA, form Next/Previous, Add, Retry).

Confirm all buttons share the same microinteraction behavior.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change button copy or routing logic.

Redesign button color variants.

Only adjust:

Global interaction behavior for the shared Button component.

The optional icon slide pattern where used.

The navbar logo sweep on the Home page.

Propose a skeleton framework

Example shared Button snippet:

// Button.jsx (simplified)
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

export function Button({ className, children, ...props }) {
  return (
    <button
      {...props}
      className={cn(
        "inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md text-sm font-medium",
        "transition-transform transition-colors duration-150 ease-out",
        "hover:brightness-110 focus-visible:brightness-110",
        "active:scale-95",
        className
      )}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}


Example for an icon-using button:

<Button onClick={handleGetStarted} className="group px-6 py-3 rounded-full">
  Get Started
  <span className="ml-2 inline-flex items-center transition-transform duration-150 group-hover:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible:translate-x-1">
    <ArrowRight className="h-4 w-4" aria-hidden="true" />
  </span>
</Button>


Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the shared Button component, Home CTA usage, other button usages, and the navbar logo behavior.

You may perform manual or small component-level tests.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
