Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page currently includes an “Is this for me?” section with orange styling and two parts (“Reframe.me might help if…” and “This is not…”).

I have already moved this section to the location I want on the page.
Do not change its position in the layout.
Only convert the current card-style section into an accordion-style UI in the same location.

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – “Is this for me?” as an orange accordion, same location

Convert the existing “Is this for me?” section so that:

Location:

The section must stay exactly where it currently is in the Home page layout.

You may not move it above or below other sections, and you must not reorder any sections.

Only the internal UI of this section should change (card → accordion).

Accordion behavior:

The section becomes a single accordion item:

Collapsed by default when the page loads.

Clicking (or pressing Enter/Space on) the header toggles the content open/closed.

The visible header/trigger text should be:

“Is this for me?” (this is the label on the accordion button/trigger).

Under the hood, it should be implemented using:

A <button> or accessible trigger element with:

aria-expanded

aria-controls

An associated content panel id.

Keyboard accessible (Tab focus, Enter/Space to toggle).

Accordion content (expanded panel):

Inside the expanded content, keep the two conceptual sections:

A “Reframe.me might help if…” part with bullets.

A “This is not…” part with bullets.

Suggested content structure (you can use this copy or very close to it):

Subheading 1: “Reframe.me might help if:”

You’re applying for jobs after a conviction or justice involvement.

You feel stuck on what to say when your background comes up in the hiring process.

You’ve received (or are worried about) a pre-adverse action notice and don’t know how to respond.

Subheading 2: “This is not:”

Legal advice or a substitute for speaking with a lawyer or legal aid.

A guarantee that you will be hired or keep a job.

A replacement for your own judgment or support from trusted people in your life.

Tone should remain:

Gentle, clear, non-judgmental.

Explicit about limits (no legal advice, no guarantees).

Styling (keep orange theme):

The accordion’s container should still use orange-accented styling, similar to the current card:

For example, a rounded border with border-orange-400/30, a light orange-tinted background like bg-orange-500/5, and orange heading/label text such as text-orange-400.

The accordion header (“Is this for me?”) should:

Be clearly visible and tappable/clickable.

Use orange or partially orange styling to tie into the theme (e.g., orange text or icon).

Include an affordance (chevron icon or +/-) that rotates/changes when expanded.

The expanded content should:

Have comfortable spacing between subheadings and bullet lists.

Use muted text for body copy (text-muted-foreground), with key labels in orange.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Accordion displays “Is this for me?” header, collapsed by default

Given the user loads the Home page

When they scroll to the “Is this for me?” section

Then:

They see a single accordion header labeled “Is this for me?”.

The content under that header is collapsed/hidden by default (only the header area is visible).

The header uses orange-accented styling and looks clickable.

Scenario: Expanding the accordion shows “might help if” and “This is not” content

Given the “Is this for me?” accordion is collapsed

When the user clicks/taps the header or presses Enter/Space on it

Then:

The accordion expands smoothly.

The panel shows:

A subheading like “Reframe.me might help if:” with bullets describing appropriate situations.

A subheading like “This is not:” with bullets describing what Reframe.me is not (no legal advice, no guarantees, etc.).

The content is readable, with clear separation between the two lists.

Scenario: Accordion can be collapsed again

Given the “Is this for me?” accordion is expanded

When the user clicks/taps the header again (or uses Enter/Space)

Then:

The panel collapses, hiding the detailed bullets.

Only the header remains visible.

Scenario: Location is unchanged

Given the “Is this for me?” section was already placed where I wanted it on the Home page

When the accordion is implemented

Then:

The section appears in the same spot in the Home layout as before.

The relative ordering of other sections (hero, feature cards, How It Works, Safe-space, Stories of Change, etc.) remains unchanged.

Scenario: Accessibility attributes present

Given the accordion is implemented

When inspecting the DOM

Then:

The header/trigger has aria-expanded and aria-controls attributes that reflect the open/closed state.

The content panel has an id that matches aria-controls.

The header is focusable and can be toggled with keyboard input.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current “Is this for me?” section

Locate the existing component/section that renders the “Is this for me?” content (orange card with “Reframe.me might help if…” and “This is not…”).

Confirm its current location in the Home component and do not change that location.

Identify the container and styling currently used for this section (border, background, typography).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain that:

You will wrap the existing content into an accordion pattern, instead of showing it all at once.

The visible header/trigger text will be “Is this for me?”.

The content inside will keep the “might help if” and “This is not” split with bullet lists.

The overall orange styling remains, but now applied to an accordion container.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

You do not move the section up or down the page—only change its internal UI.

The new accordion is fully keyboard accessible and screen-reader friendly.

The orange styling remains consistent with how the section looked before (brand color, non-error vibe).

The change does not affect other sections’ layout or spacing.

Propose best-practice implementation details

Suggested pattern:

Introduce local state like:

const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);


The header/trigger is a <button>:

<button
  type="button"
  className="flex w-full items-center justify-between gap-2 text-left"
  aria-expanded={isOpen}
  aria-controls="is-this-for-me-panel"
  onClick={() => setIsOpen((prev) => !prev)}
>
  <span className="text-sm font-semibold text-orange-400 sm:text-base">
    Is this for me?
  </span>
  {/* Chevron icon that rotates when open */}
</button>


The content panel is conditionally rendered (or visually toggled):

<div
  id="is-this-for-me-panel"
  className={clsx(
    "mt-3 space-y-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground transition-[max-height,opacity] duration-300",
    isOpen ? "opacity-100 max-h-[999px]" : "opacity-0 max-h-0 overflow-hidden"
  )}
>
  {/* “Reframe.me might help if…” + “This is not” blocks */}
</div>


Keep the same surrounding card container:

<section ...>
  <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-orange-400/30 bg-orange-500/5 p-6 md:p-7">
      {/* Accordion header + content here */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Open the component file where the “Is this for me?” section is defined.

Wrap the existing textual content inside an accordion pattern:

Extract the current heading + bullets into the accordion content panel.

Create a new header/trigger row labeled “Is this for me?” above that content.

Add React state (isOpen) to control whether the accordion is expanded.

Wire up the button’s onClick to toggle isOpen.

Add proper accessibility attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls, panel id).

Use Tailwind classes to:

Keep the orange card container styling.

Animate open/close via opacity and max-height transitions.

Verify on mobile and desktop:

The section appears in the same place as before.

It’s collapsed by default.

Clicking / tapping / keyboard toggling expands and collapses the content smoothly.

Orange styling remains consistent.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Move this section to a new location.

Change the text of other sections or the hero.

Alter the Safe-space, How It Works, or Stories of Change sections.

Only:

Convert the existing “Is this for me?” content into an accordion-style UI in its current location.

For this prompt, remember: no e2e tests. You may perform local/component-level checks only; I’ll verify final behavior and copy in the UI.
