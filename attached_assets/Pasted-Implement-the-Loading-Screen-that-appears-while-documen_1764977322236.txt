Implement the Loading Screen that appears while documents are being generated, plus basic error handling screens for failed generation.

Business requirement – Loading & feedback

Provide a reassuring, simple Loading screen after the form submission, and prepare error handling states for generation failures (network/API issues) while preserving user data.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)

Scenario: Normal loading

Given the user has completed the multi-step form and tapped the final “Generate my documents” button

When the request to generate documents is initiated

Then they see:

A heading like “Preparing your documents…”

brief explanatory text (“This usually takes less than a minute…”)

A visual loader (spinner or subtle animation)

Optional rotating supportive quote/messages block

Scenario: Loading → Success placeholder

Given the Loading screen is active

When the mock or real API resolves successfully

Then the app will later route to the Disclaimer modal + Documents page (for now, you can route to a placeholder success screen).

Scenario: Loading → Error

Given there is a network or server error when generating

When the request fails

Then the user sees an Error screen with:

Message like “We couldn’t generate your documents right now. Nothing you entered was lost.”

Buttons: “Try Again” (retries generation) and “Go back to form” (returns to last form step with state intact).

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Same checklist:

Assess enhancement and outline steps for integrating the Loading and Error states into the existing flow.

Describe your understanding of how navigation transitions: Form → Loading → (Success or Error).

Identify considerations for preserving form data and not breaking previous pages.

Propose best-practice UX for loading and transient error states in a sensitive context.

Note any other best practices (retry logic, user messaging, accessibility).

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan (components, hooks, state machine or status enums).

Keep scope focused on client-side loading/error behavior; backend will be wired in next prompt.

Propose skeleton updates (e.g., status enum idle | loading | success | error, where it lives).

Wait for my confirmation before editing.
