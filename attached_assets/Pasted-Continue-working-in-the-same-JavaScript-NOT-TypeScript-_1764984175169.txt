Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.

Implement the Document Results Page that appears after the Disclaimer is acknowledged. This page should show either narratives, the response letter, or both, depending on the user’s original selection and the API result status.

Business requirement – Document display & actions

Build a results page that:

For Narratives only:

Shows a swipeable “stack” of narrative cards (like a horizontal carousel).

On mobile, users can swipe left and right to move between narratives one at a time.

Additionally, provide left and right arrow buttons so users can navigate without swiping (for accessibility and desktop users).

Each narrative card shows:

A label for the narrative type (e.g., “Full disclosure”, “Skills-focused”)

The narrative text (scrollable if long)

Actions: Download and Copy

There should be a clear indicator of position such as “Narrative 2 of 5” and/or dots/pagination.

For Response Letter only:

Shows a full scrollable letter card with Download and Copy actions.

For Both:

Uses a pill/tab switcher: [Narratives | Response Letter].

Narratives tab:

Uses the same swipeable card carousel described above (swipe & arrows).

Response Letter tab:

Shows the letter card with Download and Copy.

Includes a Download All Documents button that downloads all generated documents together.

Reflects partial/total failure states (e.g., some documents missing) with messages and retry options.

Important:
In this prompt, do NOT implement any functionality for regenerating narratives or the response letter.
Do not show “Regenerate” buttons or wire any regeneration logic.
Regeneration will be implemented in a separate prompt.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Narratives only

Given the user selected “Narrative Generator” and the API returned narratives successfully

When they reach the Documents Page after the disclaimer

Then they see:

A swipeable card interface where only one narrative card is in focus at a time.

The user can swipe left/right on mobile to move between narratives.

The user can also tap left and right arrow buttons to navigate narratives.

Each card displays:

A clear label indicating narrative type

Narrative content (with scrolling if needed)

Buttons: Download and Copy (no Regenerate)

A visible indicator like “Narrative 1 of 5” or pagination dots so users know where they are.

A “Download All Narratives” button.

Scenario: Response Letter only

Given the user selected “Response Letter” and the API returned a letter

When they reach the Documents Page

Then they see:

A letter card with full letter text (scrollable if long).

Buttons: Download and Copy (no Regenerate).

Scenario: Both

Given the user selected “Both Documents” and both narratives and letter were generated

When they reach the Documents Page

Then they see:

A pill/tab navigation: [Narratives | Response Letter].

Under Narratives, the same swipeable card carousel described above (swipe + arrow buttons + Download/Copy + position indicator).

Under Response Letter, the letter card with Download and Copy.

A “Download All Documents” button that downloads all generated documents together.

Scenario: Partial / Total failure states

Given the API returned partial_fail with some documents missing

When the user lands on the page

Then they see:

An inline message like “Some documents failed to generate.”

A Retry option for missing docs (this is a general retry for missing outputs, not per-document regeneration logic).

Given the API returned total_fail

Then they are directed to the Error screen rather than the Documents Page.

Again: no per-document “Regenerate” buttons or behavior should be implemented in this prompt.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and outline how the Documents Page will consume the API response shape.

Describe your understanding of the conditional display logic based on:

Original selection ("narrative" | "responseLetter" | "both")

API status (success | partial_fail | total_fail).

Identify key considerations:

Implementing a swipeable card carousel (mobile-first) with left/right arrows for keyboard/desktop users

Keeping UI components modular (DocumentsPage, NarrativesCarousel, NarrativeCard, LetterView, Tabs, etc.)

Not breaking the Loading/Disclaimer flow.

Propose best-practice UX for:

Swiping through narratives on mobile

Accessible arrow buttons and focus states

Layout for viewing, scrolling, and switching between documents.

Assess other best practices (ARIA roles for carousels, keyboard navigation, pagination indicators, responsive layout).

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement the results layout and conditional rendering, including the swipe + arrow behavior.

Keep scope limited to display, swipe navigation, and download/copy actions only; no regeneration logic at all in this prompt.

Propose a skeleton of components: DocumentsPage, NarrativesCarousel, NarrativeCard, Tabs, LetterView, etc., and how props are passed.

Do not modify any files yet. First, output your understanding, considerations, and implementation plan. Wait for my confirmation before coding.
