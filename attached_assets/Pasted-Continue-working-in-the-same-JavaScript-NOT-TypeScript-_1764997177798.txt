Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Loading page component currently cycles through a set of loading messages, and then shows the disclaimer once generation succeeds. The current implementation:

Rotates through loadingMessages via a timer.

Loops back to the beginning, so messages repeat.

Changes text abruptly (no fade/transition).

I want to improve this experience and add a new motivational quotes phase at the end.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may run local/manual checks within the Loading component, but no e2e suites. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – One-pass loading messages + motivational quotes with fades

Update the Loading component (provided in my prompt) so that:

Loading messages behavior (top phase)

The existing loadingMessages array:

const loadingMessages = [
  "Analyzing your information...",
  "Crafting your personalized narrative...",
  "Preparing your documents...",
  "Almost there...",
];


Still appears in sequence, but only progresses forward once, not in an infinite loop:

Start at index 0.

Advance to index 1, 2, then 3.

When it reaches "Almost there..." (the last message), stop advancing.

Transitions between messages should use a fade effect, not an abrupt text change:

E.g., fade out the current message and fade in the next one with a simple opacity transition using Tailwind classes and state (no complex animation library required unless you prefer).

Introduce a second phase with motivational quotes

After the loading messages have reached the last message ("Almost there...") and stopped:

Keep displaying "Almost there..." as the primary loading text.

Introduce a new section below that displays rotating motivational quotes about persistence, growth, and turning your life around.

The quotes should:

Be positive, life-affirming, and sensitive to the experience of justice-involved individuals.

Be famous quotes by recognizable people.

Rotate every 3 seconds, fading into each other (similar opacity fade effect).

Not cause layout jumpiness—elements below should be smoothly moved down when this quote area appears.

Quotes to use

Please hard-code the following 7 quotes (text + attribution) into a quotes array or similar:

“It always seems impossible until it is done.” — Nelson Mandela

“I can be changed by what happens to me. But I refuse to be reduced by it.” — Maya Angelou

“Stumbling is not falling.” — Malcolm X

“Turn your wounds into wisdom.” — Oprah Winfrey

“There is no future without forgiveness.” — Desmond Tutu

“Failure is an important part of your growth and developing resilience.” — Michelle Obama

“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” — Frederick Douglass

These quotes should live in a dedicated array like const motivationalQuotes = [ ... ].

Only one quote is visible at a time.

They should fade in/out every 3 seconds once the quote phase has started.

Layout and UX details

The existing spinner, heading (“Generating Your Documents”), and main loading message should remain in place.

After reaching "Almost there...", introduce the quote area below the main loading message and above the “This usually takes just a few seconds.” line (or adjust position slightly to make visual sense).

The quote area should:

Be styled consistently with the rest of the app (e.g., smaller text, softer tone).

Not overwhelm the main loading message—this is supportive secondary content.

Accessibility:

The main loading message may remain aria-live="polite".

The rotating quotes should not spam screen readers every 3 seconds; avoid aria-live on the quotes container, or mark it as aria-hidden if needed.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Loading messages fade and do not loop

Given the user arrives on the Loading page and generation is in progress

When the page begins showing loading messages

Then:

The messages appear in order:

“Analyzing your information...”

“Crafting your personalized narrative...”

“Preparing your documents...”

“Almost there...”

Each message transition is a fade (opacity transition), not an abrupt text swap.

Once “Almost there...” appears, the loading messages stop advancing and do not loop back to the beginning.

Scenario: Motivational quotes appear after final loading message

Given the loading messages have reached the final message “Almost there...”

When the app remains on the Loading page (e.g., generation is still running)

Then:

The "Almost there..." message remains visible.

A new motivational quote area appears below the main loading text.

The first quote from the motivationalQuotes array is displayed.

Scenario: Quotes rotate with fade every 3 seconds

Given the motivational quote area is visible

When time passes

Then:

Quotes change every 3 seconds, cycling through all 7 quotes.

Each change uses a fade effect (old quote fades out, new one fades in).

After the last quote, it is acceptable to loop back to the first quote, as long as the transitions remain smooth and non-distracting.

Scenario: Layout adjusts smoothly

Given the user is on the Loading page

When the quote area appears

Then:

Existing elements below (like the “This usually takes just a few seconds.” text) are moved down smoothly and remain visible.

There are no sudden jumps or overlapping elements.

Scenario: No changes to error handling or disclaimer flow

Given document generation fails or succeeds

When an error occurs or the disclaimer appears

Then:

All existing error-handling UI and the DisclaimerModal behavior remain unchanged.

The new quote behavior is only active while the Loading state is active and before navigation to results.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and identify relevant code

Use the provided Loading component as your starting point.

Identify the current logic that:

Manages messageIndex and the setInterval that cycles messages.

Renders loadingMessages[messageIndex].

Plan how to:

Convert the infinite loop into a one-pass sequence.

Introduce a new quote phase triggered after reaching the last message.

Add fading transitions for both loading messages and quotes.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain how:

The loading messages should transition once, then stop at “Almost there...”.

A new quote rotation should start only after the final message is reached.

Both loading messages and quotes should use fade effects.

The quotes area should be supportive and not intrusive (no ARIA spam).

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

The generationState and navigation logic (error → error UI, success → disclaimer) remain intact.

The DisclaimerModal still opens when status is success.

No changes to generateDocuments or backend API calls.

The new intervals are properly cleaned up with clearInterval to avoid memory leaks or double timers.

Propose best-practice UX for transitions

Outline:

How to implement the fade transitions with Tailwind (e.g., transition-opacity duration-500, conditional opacity-0 / opacity-100).

How to structure the quote container so that it doesn’t cause layout thrashing.

A reasonable initial delay between reaching “Almost there...” and showing the first quote (if any), or immediate display.

Assess other best practices

Accessibility:

Use aria-live="polite" for the single, main loading message only.

Consider not marking the rotating quotes as live content.

Performance:

Keep timers simple (one for loading messages, one for quotes).

Clean up timers in useEffect cleanup functions.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Adjust the useEffect that updates messageIndex:

Instead of using modulo (% loadingMessages.length), stop incrementing when you reach the last index.

When the last index is reached, set a flag like hasReachedFinalMessage or showQuotes.

Step 2: Add state for the quote logic:

currentQuoteIndex

showQuotes or similar Boolean triggered when final loading message is reached.

Step 3: Add a useEffect to handle quote rotation:

Starts only when showQuotes is true.

Changes currentQuoteIndex every 3000ms.

Uses a fade effect for each quote transition (e.g., via a isQuoteVisible or CSS transitions).

Step 4: Update JSX:

Keep the spinner, heading, and main message as-is.

Wrap the main loading message in a container with fade classes.

Insert a new block for the quotes below the main loading message, conditionally rendered when showQuotes is true.

Ensure the “This usually takes just a few seconds.” text moves down naturally and remains visible.

Step 5: Manually test:

Shorten timers temporarily, if needed, to verify progression: messages 1–4, then quotes.

Confirm that no errors appear in the console and that navigation on success/error still works.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Alter backend APIs or the generation logic.

Modify the error UI or disclaimer behavior.

Only adjust:

Loading message sequencing and animation.

The new motivational quote rotation behavior.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide simplified pseudo-code / JSX for the new state and render structure, e.g.:

const [messageIndex, setMessageIndex] = useState(0);
const [showQuotes, setShowQuotes] = useState(false);
const [quoteIndex, setQuoteIndex] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  if (generationState.status !== "loading") return;

  if (messageIndex === loadingMessages.length - 1) {
    setShowQuotes(true);
    return;
  }

  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setMessageIndex(prev => prev + 1);
  }, 2000);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [generationState.status, messageIndex]);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!showQuotes) return;

  const timer = setInterval(() => {
    setQuoteIndex(prev => (prev + 1) % motivationalQuotes.length);
  }, 3000);

  return () => clearInterval(timer);
}, [showQuotes]);


And a quotes section:

{showQuotes && (
  <div className="mt-6 text-sm text-muted-foreground transition-opacity duration-500">
    {motivationalQuotes[quoteIndex]}
  </div>
)}


Do not run e2e tests

You may:

Update the Loading component.

Use manual/local testing in the browser or minimal component-level checks.

Do NOT run or modify any end-to-end (e2e) test suites for this change. I will manually verify the behavior in the UI.
