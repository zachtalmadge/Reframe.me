Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
I already have a “How It Works” section with 3 step cards and a small animated progress line + dot that moves as the section animates in.

Current issue:

The small animated dot displays incorrectly. It is not visually anchored at the bottom of the step cards and appears misaligned / out of place.

Desired behavior:

The progress line and dot should sit directly beneath the row (or stack) of cards, visually attached to the bottom of the steps.

The dot should move along the line at the bottom of the cards, not float elsewhere in the layout.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Correct the dot/line placement under the How It Works cards

Update the How It Works progress indicator so that:

Line + dot are positioned at the bottom of the step cards

The progress line should:

Run horizontally just below the bottom edge of the 3 step cards on desktop.

On mobile (stacked cards), it can still appear as a horizontal line under the last card or under a compact indicator row.

The animated dot should:

Sit on top of this line, centered vertically on it.

Move along the line, but never appear above/overlapping the cards or floating away.

No overlap with cards or outside the section

The line and dot should:

Stay within the How It Works section and the visual bounds of the steps container.

Not overlap the card content area or bleed into adjacent sections (hero, footer, etc.).

The positioning should be consistent and stable across different screen sizes.

Reuse existing animation logic, just fix layout

Keep:

The existing logic that animates the line/dot when the section enters the viewport.

The scroll trigger behavior (Intersection Observer / useInView, etc.).

Only update:

The positioning / layout of the line and dot so they render correctly at the bottom of the cards.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Dot appears directly under the cards

Given the user scrolls to the How It Works section

When the section enters the viewport and the steps animate in

Then:

A horizontal line is visible just below the bottom of the 3 step cards.

The small animated dot is clearly sitting on that line, visually connected to the steps.

Scenario: Dot moves along the bottom line, not elsewhere

Given the progress animation runs

When the line fills and the dot moves

Then:

The dot travels along the bottom line only, from left to right (or step to step).

It never appears over the card content, above the cards, or off to the side.

Scenario: Layout works on mobile and desktop

Given the user is on:

A mobile viewport (narrow) and

A desktop viewport (wide)

When they reach the How It Works section

Then:

The cards align properly (stacked on mobile, row or grid on desktop).

The line + dot are still clearly attached to the bottom of the card group, not floating elsewhere.

No overflow or clipping issues occur.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current How It Works progress indicator layout

Locate the JSX for the progress line + dot in the How It Works section (likely inside the same component as the step cards).

Identify:

The parent container that wraps the cards.

The container that wraps the line + dot (currently something like an absolutely positioned div with top-full, etc.).

Understand how absolute / relative positioning is currently set up.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That the progress line must be visually anchored immediately under the cards.

That the dot must move along that line, not above/overlapping or off-screen.

That the existing animation logic (on scroll, fill, movement) should be preserved.

Identify key considerations to avoid breaking existing behavior

Ensure:

You maintain relative positioning on the correct parent container (typically the group containing the cards AND the line/dot).

The line/dot placement works both in mobile stacked layout and desktop grid layout.

You avoid absolute placement relative to a container that doesn’t match the cards’ bounding box (which can cause misplacement).

Propose best-practice layout fix

Suggested approach:

Wrap the cards and progress bar in a single relative container:

<div className="relative max-w-4xl mx-auto">
  {/* cards grid */}
  {/* progress line + dot anchored under cards */}
</div>


Place the line + dot inside this container but positioned in a way that logically sits at the bottom:

For example, use a div after the cards with mt-4 or mt-6 and manage the dot as a child element with absolute positioning relative to the line, not the entire section.

Avoid overly complex absolute positioning like left-1/2 top-full -translate-x-1/2 if it causes misalignment; instead:

Make the line a normal block element under the cards,

Position the dot absolute within that line container.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Confirm or adjust the parent container for the How It Works cards and progress indicator to be relative.

Step 2: Move or refactor the progress line/dot markup so it sits directly below the cards in the DOM structure.

Step 3: Implement a line container like:

<div className="mt-4 md:mt-6">
  <div className="relative h-1 bg-muted rounded-full overflow-hidden">
    {/* animated fill + dot go here */}
  </div>
</div>


Step 4: Position the dot inside this line container so it sits on the line:

For example:

<div
  className={`absolute -top-1 h-3 w-3 rounded-full bg-primary transition-transform duration-500 ease-out ${
    hasEnteredView ? "translate-x-[calc(100%-0.75rem)]" : "translate-x-0"
  }`}
/>


Or compute the dot’s transform using percentages so it moves from left to right along the line.

Step 5: Verify that the progress line container uses mt-* spacing rather than top-full from an unrelated parent, so it always sits directly beneath the cards.

Step 6: Manually test on:

Desktop: ensure the dot/line are directly under the card row.

Mobile: ensure they appear under the stacked cards and stay within the section.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the step titles/descriptions or the number of steps.

Remove or rewrite the animation logic for the line/dot (except adjusting transforms/positions to match the new layout).

Only adjust:

Positioning and layout of the line and dot so they display correctly at the bottom of the cards.

Propose a skeleton framework (refined positioning)

Example (simplified, focusing on the bottom placement):

<section ref={ref} className="py-12 px-4">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center mb-8">
    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">How it works</h2>
  </div>

  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    {/* Steps */}
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 gap-6 md:grid-cols-3">
      {steps.map((step, index) => (
        <div
          key={step.title}
          className={`rounded-xl border bg-white p-6 text-left transition-opacity transition-transform duration-300 ease-out ${
            hasEnteredView ? "opacity-100 translate-y-0" : "opacity-0 translate-y-4"
          }`}
          style={{
            transitionDelay: hasEnteredView ? `${index * 100}ms` : "0ms",
          }}
        >
          {/* step content */}
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>

    {/* Progress line + dot anchored directly under cards */}
    <div className="mt-4 md:mt-6">
      <div className="relative h-1 bg-muted rounded-full overflow-hidden">
        <div
          className={`absolute inset-y-0 left-0 bg-primary transition-all duration-500 ease-out ${
            hasEnteredView ? "w-full" : "w-0"
          }`}
        />
        <div
          className={`absolute -top-1 h-3 w-3 rounded-full bg-primary transition-transform duration-500 ease-out ${
            hasEnteredView ? "translate-x-full" : "translate-x-0"
          }`}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


Adjust the dot’s translate-x values and widths to align exactly with the line and card positions.

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the How It Works section’s layout and progress indicator styling/positioning.

You may perform manual or component-level checks.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
