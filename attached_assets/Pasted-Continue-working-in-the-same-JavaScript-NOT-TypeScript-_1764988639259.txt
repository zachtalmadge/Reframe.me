Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The regenerate feature and 3x limits are already implemented and functionally correct.

There is a UI bug: when the app is viewed in a full-size / desktop layout, the tooltip that appears when the Regenerate button is disabled (after 3 regenerations) gets cut off and cannot be fully seen.
On smaller/mobile views it may appear fine, but in full-width view the tooltip is partially hidden by its container.

Business requirement – Tooltip must be fully visible

Fix the tooltip so that:

The full tooltip text is visible on all screen sizes, including full-size / desktop layouts.

The tooltip is not clipped or cut off by parent containers, scrollable areas, or page boundaries.

The tooltip remains visually associated with the disabled Regenerate button and keeps the same gentle, supportive message.

The existing 3x regen limit logic and button disabling behavior must not change—only the display/positioning of the tooltip is being corrected.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Tooltip visibility on full-size / desktop view

Given the user has regenerated a narrative or the pre-adverse action response letter 3 times, reaching the limit

When they view the Documents Page in a full-size / desktop layout and hover/focus/tap on the disabled “Regenerate” button

Then:

The tooltip is fully visible, showing the entire message.

The tooltip is not clipped by the narrative card, its parent container, or any scroll region.

The tooltip appears close enough to the disabled button that it is clearly associated with it.

Scenario: Tooltip behavior on mobile view

Given the user is on a mobile or small-screen device and has hit the 3x regen limit for a narrative or letter

When they tap or otherwise trigger the tooltip on the disabled “Regenerate” button

Then:

The tooltip is fully readable on the small screen.

It does not render off-screen or under other UI elements.

It remains consistent with mobile-first design (legible size, adequate padding).

Scenario: No functional regressions

Given the 3x regeneration limit and persistence logic were working before this change

When this tooltip display fix is implemented

Then:

The 3x limit per narrative and per letter is still enforced.

The disabled state and tooltip still only appear after 3 successful regenerations.

Regeneration, document display, swipe carousel, Download, and Copy functionality are not broken or changed.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and bug context

Identify where the tooltip component is implemented (e.g., inside the narrative/letter card component).

Identify which parent containers (cards, carousels, modals) might be causing clipping due to CSS such as overflow: hidden, overflow: auto, or z-index issues.

Decide whether to:

Adjust container overflow/positioning, and/or

Render the tooltip in a higher layer (e.g., via a portal attached to document.body), and/or

Adjust tooltip positioning to stay within the viewport.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

How the tooltip should behave for the disabled Regenerate button.

Why it’s currently getting cut off (e.g., card with overflow-hidden, parent with limited height, z-index stacking).

How the new solution will ensure the tooltip is fully visible on both mobile and desktop.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Avoid breaking:

The swipeable narratives carousel.

Scroll behavior inside cards.

Overall layout on mobile and desktop.

Consider accessibility:

Tooltip should be reachable via keyboard focus and screen readers where possible.

Ensure tooltip remains visible above other content and respects stacking contexts.

Propose best-practice UX for this tooltip

Where should the tooltip appear relative to the disabled button (above, below, side, auto-position)?

How should it behave on:

Hover/focus (desktop).

Tap/long-press (mobile).

How to keep the tooltip within viewport bounds (e.g., flipping to the other side if close to an edge).

Assess other best practices

Tailwind-friendly implementation for positioning (absolute, fixed, z-50, etc.).

Whether to use a small, reusable tooltip component for future use.

ARIA attributes for accessible tooltip behavior (e.g., aria-describedby).

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this fix

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Locate the tooltip implementation and its parent containers (card, carousel, any wrappers).

Step 2: Decide on an implementation approach:

Option A: Adjust card/container styles to allow tooltip overflow (overflow-visible) while preserving layout.

Option B: Render tooltip in a portal at the document root with absolute/fixed positioning and high z-index.

Step 3: Implement updated tooltip styling/positioning using Tailwind classes.

Step 4: Test:

Desktop full-width view

Mobile view

Narratives + letter, with 3x limit hit

Step 5: Verify no regressions to regeneration logic, carousel, and other controls.

Keep the scope limited

Only fix the tooltip visibility and positioning.

Do not change:

The 3x limit logic

The underlying regenerate API calls

The card content or Documents Page structure beyond what is necessary for the tooltip.

Propose a skeleton framework

Show, in pseudo-code or simplified JSX, how you will:

Wrap the disabled Regenerate button with the tooltip trigger.

Position the tooltip (e.g., relative parent + absolute tooltip, or a portal-based approach).

Apply Tailwind classes to ensure proper z-index and overflow behavior.
