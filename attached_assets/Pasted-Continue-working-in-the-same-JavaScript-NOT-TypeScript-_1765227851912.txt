After documents are generated, the app shows a disclaimer modal before navigating to /results.

On smaller viewports (e.g., mobile), there is a bug:

The disclaimer modal’s content is longer than the viewport.

No scrollbar appears, and the user cannot scroll to see all of the disclaimer text.

As a result, the user is unable to view the full disclaimer content and may not be able to reach the bottom buttons.

I need you to fix this so that the disclaimer modal is fully usable on small screens:

The user must be able to scroll through the entire disclaimer content.

The close/continue buttons must remain accessible.

Important for this change:

For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only (e.g., manual interaction or unit tests if you have them). I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Do not make any code changes yet.
First, assess the current implementation, describe your understanding, identify key considerations, and generate a step-by-step plan.
Wait for my explicit approval before editing any files.

Business requirement – Disclaimer modal must be scrollable and fully readable on small screens

Update the disclaimer modal so that:

On small viewports (e.g., mobile, short laptop windows):

The modal’s content area (the inner body with the disclaimer text) is scrollable when the content exceeds available height.

The user can vertically scroll to read the entire disclaimer, down to the bottom.

The buttons at the bottom of the modal remain accessible:

Either pinned at the bottom of the modal, or

Reachable by scrolling.

On larger viewports:

The modal should behave as before, but it’s fine (and often preferable) if:

The content is still scrollable when it exceeds height, instead of overflowing off-screen.

Specifics:

The backdrop behavior (dimming background, preventing background scroll) should remain as currently implemented.

The text content and copy of the disclaimer should not change—only layout/scroll behavior.

The modal must remain visually consistent with the rest of the app’s design (rounded corners, shadows, etc.), while now supporting content overflow.

If the disclaimer modal shares a generic modal component with other modals:

Implement the scroll behavior in a way that:

Either improves all modals safely, or

Is controlled by a prop (e.g., scrollable or withScrollableBody) so that:

The disclaimer modal has a scrollable body.

Other modals are not inadvertently broken.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Disclaimer modal on a small mobile viewport

Given the user completes generation and the disclaimer modal appears on a small/mobile screen

When the disclaimer text is longer than the visible portion of the modal

Then:

A scrollable area is available inside the modal.

The user can scroll vertically to read the entire disclaimer content.

The bottom buttons (e.g., Continue, Close) are accessible (either always visible or reachable via scroll).

No part of the disclaimer is permanently cut off.

Scenario: Disclaimer modal on a larger viewport

Given the user is on a larger screen (desktop or tablet)

When the disclaimer modal appears

Then:

The modal layout looks correct and centered as before.

If the text fits within the viewport, it may not show a scrollbar.

If the text exceeds the viewport height, the content area becomes scrollable instead of overflowing off-screen.

Scenario: Background scroll and accessibility behavior unchanged

Given the disclaimer modal is open

When the user scrolls or interacts

Then:

Background content behind the modal does not scroll (same as current behavior).

The modal still blocks interaction with the page behind it.

Any existing keyboard / accessibility behavior (e.g., focus trapping, Escape to close if implemented) continues to work as before.

Scenario: No regressions to other modals

Given there are other modals in the app (e.g., refresh warnings, logo click warnings)

When this fix is applied

Then:

Other modals still render and function normally.

If the scroll behavior is implemented at a shared modal level, it should not cause layout breakage for other modal types.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current disclaimer modal implementation

Identify the component responsible for the disclaimer modal that appears after generation but before navigating to /results.

Determine:

The outer overlay/backdrop structure (likely fixed inset-0 + background).

The modal dialog container (centered panel).

The content/body area where the disclaimer text lives.

The footer/button area (e.g., Continue / Close buttons).

Note existing Tailwind classes related to:

Sizing: max-w-*, w-full, max-h-*.

Overflow: overflow-hidden, overflow-y-auto, etc.

Positioning: fixed, absolute, inset-*, top-1/2 / transform, etc.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will ensure the body/content of the disclaimer modal uses a scrollable layout when the content height exceeds the available space, especially on small viewports.

That the user must be able to scroll through all disclaimer text while the buttons remain accessible.

That you will not change the disclaimer copy or when it appears—only its layout/overflow behavior.

That if a shared modal component is used, you’ll either enhance it safely or gate the new behavior behind a prop.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Make sure:

You don’t create a confusing double-scroll (page + modal) scenario—modal content should be the primary scroll.

The modal remains visually centered or appropriately placed on small screens (padding/margins may differ by breakpoint).

Other modals that reuse shared components are not unintentionally broken by the overflow changes.

Any focus-trap / accessibility logic still works as intended.

Propose best-practice implementation details

A typical Tailwind approach (you can adapt):

<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-6 sm:px-6">
  {/* Backdrop */}
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/60" aria-hidden="true" />

  {/* Dialog */}
  <div className="relative z-10 w-full max-w-lg">
    <div className="overflow-hidden rounded-2xl bg-background shadow-lg border border-border">
      {/* Optional header */}
      <div className="px-4 py-3 border-b border-border">
        <h2 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground">
          Disclaimer
        </h2>
      </div>

      {/* Scrollable body */}
      <div className="max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto px-4 py-4 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        {/* Disclaimer text content */}
      </div>

      {/* Footer with buttons */}
      <div className="px-4 py-3 border-t border-border flex justify-end gap-3">
        {/* Buttons */}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>


Key ideas:

Use a max-h-[Xvh] constraint (e.g., max-h-[60vh] or max-h-[70vh]) on the scrollable area.

Apply overflow-y-auto to the content body to allow vertical scroll.

Maintain padding and the existing style tokens so it feels consistent with the rest of the app.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this fix

At a minimum include:

Open the disclaimer modal component file.

Identify the core elements: backdrop, dialog panel, body/content, footer/buttons.

Add appropriate max-h-[vh] and overflow-y-auto classes to the content/body container (or inner panel) so that:

The modal doesn’t overflow beyond the viewport vertically.

Disclaimer text becomes scrollable when it exceeds the height.

Adjust padding/margins as needed so:

The header and footer (if present) do not get cut off.

On mobile, the modal uses sensible px/py so it fits within the viewport.

Manually test:

On a small viewport: verify content can be fully scrolled and buttons are accessible.

On a large viewport: verify the layout still looks correct and no unwanted scrollbars appear when not needed.

If the modal leverages a shared modal component:

Decide whether to add a scrollableBody prop or similar.

Ensure only the disclaimer modal turns this behavior on, unless a general improvement is clearly safe.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the wording of the disclaimer.

Change when the disclaimer is shown or how the user proceeds.

Modify other unrelated flows (form, selection, results).

Only:

Fix the scroll/overflow behavior of the disclaimer modal so it’s fully readable and usable on small screens.

Final instructions

Do not modify any files yet

First:

Assess the current implementation,

Describe your understanding,

Identify key considerations, and

Provide a step-by-step plan to fix the issue.

Wait for my explicit approval that your understanding and plan are correct before making any code changes.

Remember: do NOT run any e2e tests for this change; I will verify the fix in the UI myself.
