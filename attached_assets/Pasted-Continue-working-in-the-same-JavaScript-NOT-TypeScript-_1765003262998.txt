Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
On the Home page, there is a primary “Get Started” CTA button that currently appears higher up in the layout (near the hero / feature cards).

I want to reposition this primary CTA so that it appears:

Below the “How It Works” section, and

Above the “Stories of change” carousel section.

The CTA should remain visually prominent and still function exactly as it does now (same click behavior, same routing).

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Reorder Home page sections (CTA between How It Works and Stories)

Adjust the Home page layout so that:

The primary “Get Started” CTA (the main call-to-action button) is rendered after the How It Works section.

The same CTA is rendered before the Stories of change carousel.

The CTA’s styling and behavior:

Remain consistent with its current design (size, color, microinteractions we already added).

Continue to route the user to the same next step (Selection/Form/etc.).

We’re changing layout order only, not copy or routing.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: CTA appears between How It Works and Stories of change

Given the user is on the Home page

When they scroll down the page

Then:

They first see:

Hero + feature cards

(Any Safe Zone/Privacy block, if present)

How It Works section

Immediately after How It Works, they see the primary Get Started CTA in its own clear area.

Below that CTA, they see the Stories of change carousel.

Scenario: CTA retains styling and behavior

Given the CTA has been moved in the DOM

When the user clicks the Get Started button in its new location

Then:

It triggers the same navigation / flow as before (e.g., to Selection or Form).

The button retains the same styling, hover/pressed microinteractions, and responsiveness.

Scenario: Layout remains mobile-first and responsive

Given the user views the Home page on both mobile and desktop

When they scroll past How It Works and toward Stories of change

Then:

The CTA sits comfortably between these two sections on all screen sizes.

Spacing (margins/padding) around the CTA looks intentional (no awkward gaps or collisions).

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Home page structure

Locate the Home page component where the following sections are rendered:

Hero + feature cards

Safe zone / privacy block (if present)

How It Works section

Stories of change carousel

Primary Get Started CTA button (wherever it is currently placed).

Identify:

The JSX block that renders the Get Started CTA.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That you must move (not duplicate) the primary Get Started CTA so it appears after How It Works and before Stories of change in the JSX structure.

That the CTA’s styling and click behavior must remain unchanged.

That this is a layout reordering task only.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

You do not accidentally create two primary CTAs on the page (no duplication).

You do not alter the CTA’s onClick handler or routing behavior.

Spacing is adjusted so the CTA feels visually intentional between the two sections.

Propose your layout changes (React + Tailwind)

Suggest:

Adding a dedicated CTA wrapper section between How It Works and Stories of change, e.g.:

<section className="px-4 py-8">
  <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
    <Button
      onClick={handleGetStarted}
      className="group inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full px-6 py-3 text-sm font-semibold"
    >
      Get Started
      {/* optional icon span */}
    </Button>
  </div>
</section>


Ensuring the handleGetStarted function is the same as before (or reusing the same prop/handler).

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Find the current location in the Home component where the primary Get Started CTA is rendered.

Step 2: Extract that CTA JSX into:

Either a small reusable component (e.g., <PrimaryCTA />), or

A self-contained <section> block.

Step 3: Remove the CTA from its current position near the hero/feature cards.

Step 4: Insert the same CTA block after the How It Works section JSX and before the Stories of change carousel JSX.

Step 5: Ensure the CTA uses the same props/handlers (onClick / navigate) as before.

Step 6: Manually test:

Confirm there is exactly one primary Get Started button on the page.

Confirm its new vertical order: Hero/Features → (Safe zone) → How It Works → Get Started CTA → Stories of change.

Confirm clicking it still starts the same flow as before.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change CTA copy or add new CTAs.

Modify the logic of the navigation or any form flow.

Alter the contents of How It Works or Stories of change sections.

Only adjust:

The vertical placement of the primary Get Started CTA relative to these sections.

Propose a skeleton framework

Example skeleton of the Home layout after change (simplified):

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* Hero + feature cards */}
      <HeroSection />
      <FeatureCards />

      {/* Safe zone / privacy block (if present) */}
      <SafeZoneSection />

      {/* How It Works */}
      <HowItWorksSection />

      {/* Moved primary CTA */}
      <section className="px-4 py-8">
        <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center">
          <Button
            onClick={handleGetStarted}
            className="group inline-flex items-center gap-2 rounded-full px-6 py-3 text-sm font-semibold"
          >
            Get Started
            {/* optional icon */}
          </Button>
        </div>
      </section>

      {/* Stories of change carousel */}
      <StoriesCarousel />
    </Layout>
  );
}


handleGetStarted should contain the existing navigation logic (e.g., navigate("/selection") or similar).

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the Home page layout and any small helper components needed.

You may perform manual or small component-level checks only.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
