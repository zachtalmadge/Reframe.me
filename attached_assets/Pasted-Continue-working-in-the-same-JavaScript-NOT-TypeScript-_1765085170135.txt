Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page currently includes a “Safe space / privacy” section with a Shield icon and the heading:

“A judgement-free space, built for your reality.”

Right now, this safe-space card uses an orange-leaning accent theme (or warmer accent colors) that feels more like a “call-to-action” color. For this particular block, I want a calmer, neutral theme:

Backgrounds and accents should shift to grey / black / neutral tones.

The overall feeling should be steady, grounded, and low-key, not “alert” or “warning.”

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the change myself.

A simplified version of the current section looks like this (for reference):

Business requirement – Safe-space section uses neutral grey / black palette

Update the Safe-space / privacy section so that:

The overall color theme is neutral grey / black, not orange or bright accent:

The card background should feel like a soft, dark or mid-grey surface (e.g., slate/stone tones), not a warm/orange-tinted block.

The border and hover states should use cool grey / near-black tones, not orange.

The icon container and small dots (bullets) should also shift to grey-based accents, not orange.

The text remains:

Highly readable, with good contrast against the new background (likely white / off-white text on darker grey).

Calm and supportive; no color choices that feel like an error or warning state.

The section still visually communicates:

Safety, privacy, and stability (think: charcoal, slate, muted neutrals).

Fits with the rest of the brand but clearly stands apart from orange CTAs, so it feels like a comfort zone, not a “click me” button.

This change should only affect the safe-space section’s color palette and related hover styling, not the content or structure.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Safe-space card background is neutral grey/black

Given the user is on the Home page

When they scroll to the Safe-space / privacy section

Then:

The card background appears as a neutral grey/black tone (e.g., slate/charcoal), not orange or warm.

The border color is a grey variant, not orange.

Scenario: Icon and bullets use neutral accents

Given the user is viewing the Safe-space card

When they look at the Shield icon and the small circular bullet markers

Then:

The icon’s background and stroke use grey-based hues (or a neutral accent consistent with the new theme), not orange.

The small dots in the bullet list use a neutral grey that still stands out but does not look like a warning color.

Scenario: Text is readable and fits the new palette

Given the Safe-space card’s background is darker/more neutral

When the user reads the heading, paragraph, and bullet text

Then:

The text has sufficient contrast (e.g., white/off-white on dark grey, or near-black on very light grey).

Nothing is washed out or hard to read due to low contrast.

The color combination feels calm and safe, not alarming.

Scenario: Hover state remains consistent and neutral

Given the Safe-space card has hover behavior and potential glossy shine from previous changes

When the user hovers over the card

Then:

Any hover lift, shadow, or highlight stays in the neutral grey/white family (no orange used).

The hover state looks slightly more polished but still fits the dark/neutral theme.

Scenario: No regression to layout or text content

Given the previous version of the Safe-space section

When the color theme is updated

Then:

The copy stays exactly the same.

The layout (icon on left, text on right, stacked on mobile) is unchanged.

Only colors and related hover styles are altered.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Safe-space color usage

Find the Safe-space / privacy section component and identify:

Which Tailwind classes and design tokens (bg-*, border-*, text-*, etc.) are currently applied.

Where orange or warm accent colors are used (e.g., custom tokens or Tailwind’s orange-* classes, or chart-* that map to warm tones).

Identify what global design tokens exist for neutral greys and near-black (e.g., bg-slate-900, bg-zinc-900, border-slate-700, text-slate-100, etc., or your project’s own bg-surface, bg-subtle, etc.).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will replace orange/warm accent colors in the Safe-space section with neutral grey/black tones.

That this includes card background, border, icon container, and bullet dots.

That you will maintain strong text contrast and a calm, grounded aesthetic.

That the goal is for this block to feel like a stable, safe, neutral zone, not like an urgent CTA.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

Only the Safe-space section colors are changed, not the entire site or unrelated components.

You don’t accidentally alter shared tokens used in multiple places unless you intend to update them everywhere.

The safe-space card still visually fits the overall design system (same border radius, spacing, typography).

Hover and shine effects still work and look good with the new palette.

Propose best-practice neutral palette implementation

Describe which Tailwind (or design system) classes you will use, conceptually, such as:

Card background: bg-slate-900/80, bg-slate-900, or a similar neutral.

Border: border-slate-700/60.

Icon background: bg-slate-800 with icon color text-slate-100 or similar.

Bullet dots: bg-slate-300 or bg-slate-200 depending on the background.

Explain how you will ensure:

Heading text uses text-foreground or a suitable neutral that remains readable on the new background.

Body text uses muted but readable text color (e.g., text-slate-300 on dark backgrounds).

Assess other best practices

Accessibility:

Check contrast ratios roughly (e.g., light text on dark background).

Tone:

Ensure colors feel reassuring and not like an error state.

Consistency:

Align with any existing grey/black usage elsewhere in the app (e.g., hero background, footer, etc.).

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this theme change

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Identify the Safe-space section component and its main card div.

Step 2: Replace existing background and border classes with neutral grey/black equivalents (e.g., from orange-ish or chart-* to slate/zinc/neutral classes or project-specific neutral tokens).

Step 3: Update the Shield icon container and bullet dots to use grey-based color classes.

Step 4: Adjust text classes if necessary to maintain strong contrast (e.g., text-slate-50 or text-slate-100 on a dark background).

Step 5: Confirm that any hover/shine effects previously implemented look good with the new palette and remain neutral.

Step 6: Manually verify on mobile and desktop that:

The card clearly reads as a neutral, safe zone.

Text is legible.

The section still fits visually into the surrounding Home page.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the text content of the Safe-space section.

Alter global color tokens that might break other parts of the site, unless clearly intended.

Modify any other sections’ palettes (hero, CTAs, feature cards) as part of this prompt.

Only:

Update the Safe-space section’s color theme (background, borders, icon, bullets, and text as needed for contrast).

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example of what the updated classes might look like, for example:

<section
