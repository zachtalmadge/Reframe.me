Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Results / Documents page (where narratives and the pre-adverse letter are shown), the “Start Over” button, the Learn More / FAQ page, and the global navbar + logo are already implemented and working.

Right now, on the Results page:

There is a “Start Over” button that lets the user begin a new run.

The logo and “Learn More”/FAQ navigation may take users away without a results-specific warning.

I want to:

Add a “Learn More” button in orange to the right of the “Start Over” button on the Results page.

When the user tries to leave the Results page via:

The new “Learn More” button,

The Home logo in the header,

Or the “Learn More / FAQ” tab in the navbar,
show a special warning modal that reminds them to copy/download their results before leaving.

Important constraint:
The “Start Over” button is the only control that should take them away from the Results page without any warning, and its code must not be touched or modified.

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Results page “Learn More” button + exit warning

Update the Results / Documents page so that:

A new “Learn More” button:

Appears to the right of the existing “Start Over” button (on the same row, as layout allows).

Uses the orange accent style consistent with the app’s secondary/attention color (e.g., the orange used for alerts/secondary CTAs).

Navigates the user toward the Learn More / FAQ page (existing route), but only after a confirmation modal.

A special warning modal appears when the user attempts to leave the Results page using:

The new “Learn More” button on the Results page.

The Home logo in the header (while on the Results page).

The “Learn More / FAQ” link in the navbar (while on the Results page).

The warning modal content should clearly, calmly convey something like:

“Don’t forget to copy or download your results before you leave this page.”

“Once you leave this page, you’ll need to start over to generate new narratives or letters.”

Modal behavior:

If the user confirms:

They are taken to the target destination:

For the Results page “Learn More” button → to the FAQ / Learn More page.

For the Home logo → to Home.

For the navbar Learn More tab → to the FAQ / Learn More page.

If the user cancels:

They stay on the Results page, and their current results remain visible.

The existing “Start Over” button:

Must not be changed in any way.

Continues to function exactly as it does now (starting a new run) without showing this warning modal.

This new warning modal behavior should be specific to the Results page context:

On other pages (e.g., Home, Selection, Form, Loading), the existing behaviors and warning patterns should remain unchanged, unless they already use a shared confirm-on-exit logic that you can extend in a safe, scoped way.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Learn More button appears next to Start Over

Given the user has successfully generated results and is on the Results / Documents page

When they view the main actions at the bottom/top of the page (where “Start Over” is)

Then they see a “Learn More” button in orange, positioned to the right of the existing “Start Over” button.

Scenario: Learn More button triggers special warning modal

Given the user is on the Results page and sees their narratives/letter

When they click the “Learn More” button

Then:

A warning modal appears with text reminding them to copy or download their results before leaving and that they will have to start over if they leave.

The modal includes clear Confirm and Cancel actions.

If they confirm, they are navigated to the FAQ / Learn More page.

If they cancel, they remain on the Results page and their results are still visible.

Scenario: Home logo on Results page triggers the same warning

Given the user is on the Results page with results visible

When they click the Home logo in the header

Then:

The same special warning modal appears with the “don’t forget to copy/download” message.

If they confirm, they are taken to the Home page.

If they cancel, they stay on the Results page.

Scenario: Navbar Learn More tab on Results page triggers the same warning

Given the user is on the Results page

When they click the “Learn More / FAQ” link in the navbar

Then:

The same special warning modal appears with the “copy/download” reminder.

If they confirm, they are taken to the FAQ / Learn More page.

If they cancel, they stay on the Results page.

Scenario: Start Over remains the only “no-warning” exit

Given the user is on the Results page

When they click “Start Over”

Then:

The warning modal does not appear.

The “Start Over” behavior remains exactly as currently implemented (starting a fresh run, clearing any necessary state).

The code for “Start Over” has not been modified.

Scenario: No regressions outside the Results page

Given navigation behaviors and modals previously implemented for other pages (Home, Selection, Form, Loading, FAQ)

When this new Results-specific warning is added

Then:

Existing confirmation modals for leaving the Form or Loading steps still work as before.

The new “copy/download” warning is only applied when leaving the Results page via the logo or Learn More actions.

No unexpected warnings appear on unrelated pages.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Results page and navigation behavior

Identify the component(s) that render the Results / Documents page, including:

The existing “Start Over” button.

Any existing secondary actions or buttons in that area.

Identify:

How the Home logo click is currently handled (globally or per route).

How the “Learn More / FAQ” navigation item is implemented and wired to the /faq route.

Determine whether there is already a shared confirm-on-exit modal pattern that you can reuse or extend for the Results page.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will add a new orange “Learn More” button to the Results page, to the right of the existing “Start Over” button.

That clicking this Learn More button, the Home logo (while on Results), or the navbar Learn More tab (while on Results) must all show the same special warning modal.

That this modal will remind users to copy or download their results and warn that leaving means they will have to start over.

That the Start Over button must not be changed and should remain the only way to leave the page without this specific warning.

That you must keep behavior on other pages consistent with existing patterns.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

You do not touch or modify the “Start Over” button’s handler or logic.

The new “Learn More” button uses separate state/handlers from “Start Over”.

The new modal logic is scoped so that:

It only applies when the current route is the Results page.

It doesn’t accidentally show on other pages when using the logo or Learn More nav link.

Accessibility and UX remain strong:

Modal is focus-trapped when open.

There are clear Confirm and Cancel buttons.

The modal can be dismissed with keyboard (e.g., Esc) if consistent with existing modals.

Propose best-practice implementation details

Describe how you will:

Add the Learn More button next to Start Over using Tailwind (e.g., flex row, gap, etc.), ensuring a good layout on mobile and desktop.

Implement or reuse a modal component for the warning:

With a clear title (e.g., “Before you leave this page…”).

Body text that:

Reminds to copy or download.

States that leaving will require them to start over to generate new results.

Manage modal state (e.g., isResultsExitModalOpen) and the pending destination (Home vs FAQ) so that Confirm knows where to navigate.

Explain how you will hook this up to:

The Results page Learn More button click.

The logo click handler when the current route is Results.

The navbar Learn More click when the current route is Results.

Confirm that for other routes, existing behaviors remain unchanged or continue to use their existing confirmation modals.

Assess other best practices

Tailwind usage:

Keep button styling consistent with other orange/secondary CTAs (e.g., rounded corners, hover/active states).

Use appropriate spacing between “Start Over” and “Learn More” on mobile and desktop.

Tone:

Modal text should be gentle and supportive, not alarmist.

Example tone: “We just don’t want you to lose something important by accident.”

UX:

On small screens, ensure buttons and modal content remain readable and easy to tap.

Routing:

Use existing routing patterns (wouter) to navigate after confirmation.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Locate the Results / Documents page component and the section containing the Start Over button.

Step 2: Add a new orange “Learn More” button to the right of “Start Over” in the layout.

Step 3: Implement or reuse a modal component and add new state to the Results page (or a suitable parent) to:

Track whether the results-exit warning modal is open.

Track the requested destination (Home or FAQ).

Step 4: Update:

The Results page Learn More button click handler to open this modal and set the destination to the FAQ page.

The Home logo click behavior (when current route is Results) to:

Open this modal with destination Home instead of navigating immediately.

The navbar Learn More / FAQ link (when current route is Results) to:

Open this modal with destination FAQ instead of navigating immediately.

Step 5: In the modal’s Confirm handler:

Perform the appropriate navigation (Home or FAQ).

Ensure any necessary cleanup of state occurs if required (while not modifying the Start Over logic).

Step 6: In the modal’s Cancel handler:

Close the modal and leave the user on the Results page with their results intact.

Step 7: Manually verify in the UI:

On Results page:

“Start Over” still works as before with no warning.

“Learn More” button shows the warning and navigates only after confirmation.

Logo click and navbar Learn More click show the warning and behave correctly.

On other pages:

Logo and Learn More behave as they did before this change (or continue to use any existing, appropriate confirmation patterns).

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Modify or refactor the “Start Over” button or its logic.

Change the core regenerate logic, card layout, or download/copy functionality on the Results page.

Alter existing confirmation modals for form or loading stages beyond any necessary small reuse of shared modal components.

Only:

Add the new Learn More button on the Results page.

Implement the Results-specific exit warning modal and hook it into:

Results Learn More button.

Logo click (on Results).

Navbar Learn More click (on Results).

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example of how this might look (in JavaScript React, not TypeScript), for example:

// Inside ResultsPage.jsx (simplified)
const [exitModalOpen, setExitModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [exitDestination, setExitDestination] = useState(null); // "home" | "faq"

const handleResultsLearnMoreClick = () => {
  setExitDestination("faq");
  setExitModalOpen(true);
};

const handleResultsLogoClick = () => {
  setExitDestination("home");
  setExitModalOpen(true);
};

const handleConfirmExit = () => {
  setExitModalOpen(false);
  if (exitDestination === "home") {
    // navigate to home
  } else if (exitDestination === "faq") {
    // navigate to FAQ
  }
};

const handleCancelExit = () => {
  setExitModalOpen(false);
};

return (
  <div className="flex flex-col">
    {/* Results content... */}

    <div className="mt-8 flex flex-wrap gap-3">
      <button
        type="button"
        className="btn-secondary" // existing Start Over styling
        // IMPORTANT: do not change this handler in the real code
      >
        Start over
      </button>

      <button
        type="button"
        className="rounded-full bg-orange-500 px-4 py-2 text-sm font-medium text-white hover:bg-orange-600 active:bg-orange-700"
        onClick={handleResultsLearnMoreClick}
      >
        Learn more
      </button>
    </div>

    {exitModalOpen && (
      <ResultsExitWarningModal
        onConfirm={handleConfirmExit}
        onCancel={handleCancelExit}
      />
    )}
  </div>
);


The actual implementation should reuse existing modal and navigation patterns where appropriate and must not alter the Start Over button logic.

Do not modify any files yet

First, output your understanding of this enhancement and your implementation plan.

Remember: do NOT perform any e2e tests for this change—I will manually verify it in the UI.

Wait for my confirmation that your approach is sound before updating the code.
