Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The app’s brand is currently “Reflect.me”, and the navbar (via the shared Layout / header component) uses that name and logo.

I want to rename the product from “Reflect.me” to “Reframe.me” and update:

The brand name text in the navbar, and

The logo in the navbar (image/mark), including its alt text and any related aria labels/titles.

Important for this change:
For this prompt, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm in the UI.

Business requirement – Navbar branding change Reflect.me → Reframe.me

Update the app’s navbar/header branding so that:

Anywhere in the navbar/header where the brand name “Reflect.me” appears:

It is renamed to “Reframe.me”.

This includes:

Visible text next to the logo (if present).

alt attributes on the logo image.

aria-labels on the logo link or brand link.

Any title attributes or screen-reader only text specific to the brand.

The logo graphic in the navbar should be updated:

Replace the existing Reflect.me logo asset with the new Reframe.me logo asset (or point to the new file if it’s already in the repo).

Ensure:

The import path or src for the logo is updated wherever the navbar uses it.

The logo renders correctly at all breakpoints (mobile and desktop).

Scope is limited to navbar/header branding:

Focus on what appears in the global navigation bar at the top of the app.

Do not rename deeply embedded text elsewhere (like feature descriptions or docs) unless the navbar component is reused there.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Navbar shows “Reframe.me” instead of “Reflect.me”

Given the user loads any page that uses the shared Layout/navbar

When they look at the top navigation bar

Then:

The visible brand name (if present) reads “Reframe.me” (not “Reflect.me”).

The logo’s alt text and any aria-label reference “Reframe.me”.

Scenario: Logo asset is updated

Given the new Reframe.me logo asset is available in the codebase

When the navbar renders

Then:

The logo displayed is the new Reframe.me logo (correct file/source).

It renders properly on mobile and desktop layouts (no broken image, correct sizing, no layout glitches).

Scenario: Logo link semantics are updated

Given the logo area in the navbar is clickable (usually linking to Home)

When the user inspects attributes or uses a screen reader

Then:

Any ARIA labels, alt text, or titles reference “Reframe.me”.

There are no leftover references to “Reflect.me” in the navbar markup.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current navbar/header implementation

Locate the shared layout / navbar component (e.g., Layout.jsx, Navbar.jsx, or similar) that:

Renders the logo.

Renders the brand name text (“Reflect.me”) if present.

Identify:

How the logo is imported (path to the current logo asset).

Where “Reflect.me” is hard-coded (text, alt, aria-label, etc.).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That the brand name must be changed from Reflect.me → Reframe.me in the navbar.

That the navbar logo asset should be updated to the new Reframe.me logo.

That associated alt/aria labels must be updated for accessibility and consistency.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

Navigation behavior (e.g., clicking the logo to go Home) remains unchanged.

Layout and responsiveness are unaffected—logo sizing and spacing should still behave well on mobile/desktop.

There are no lingering references to “Reflect.me” in the navbar code.

Propose best-practice implementation

Suggest:

Keeping the brand name in a single constant or config (e.g., const APP_NAME = "Reframe.me";) to avoid scattered strings.

Using meaningful alt text, such as:

alt="Reframe.me logo"

aria-label="Reframe.me home" on the link wrapping the logo.

Confirm that the logo asset is optimized for web (reasonable size, SVG or compressed image).

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Search the codebase for “Reflect.me” and identify all navbar-related occurrences.

Step 2: Update the navbar brand text to “Reframe.me”.

Step 3: Update the logo import/source in the navbar:

Replace the old logo component/import with the new Reframe.me logo asset.

Ensure the file path and file type are correct.

Step 4: Update alt text, aria-labels, and any title attributes on the logo or brand link to use “Reframe.me”.

Step 5: Manually check the navbar across:

Home page

Form, Loading, Results/Documents pages (anywhere Layout is used)

Confirm the branding is consistent and no old logo/text appears.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change body copy, document text, or deep content references to Reflect.me in other components unless they are part of the navbar.

Modify routing or CTA labels as part of this prompt.

Only adjust:

Navbar logo asset.

Navbar brand name text.

Logo-related alt/aria/title text.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified JSX example of what the updated navbar snippet might look like, for example:

// inside Layout or Navbar
import ReframeLogo from "@/assets/reframe-logo.svg"; // example path

function Navbar() {
  const [, navigate] = useLocation();

  const handleLogoClick = () => {
    navigate("/");
  };

  return (
    <header className="w-full border-b bg-background">
      <div className="mx-auto flex max-w-6xl items-center justify-between px-4 py-3">
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={handleLogoClick}
          className="flex items-center gap-2"
          aria-label="Reframe.me home"
        >
          <img
            src={ReframeLogo}
            alt="Reframe.me logo"
            className="h-8 w-auto"
          />
          <span className="text-base font-semibold">
            Reframe.me
          </span>
        </button>
        {/* other navbar content */}
      </div>
    </header>
  );
}


Clarify that the actual logo import path and size should match the project’s structure and design system.

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the Layout/Navbar and logo import paths.

You may perform manual or component-level checks.

Do NOT run or modify any end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
