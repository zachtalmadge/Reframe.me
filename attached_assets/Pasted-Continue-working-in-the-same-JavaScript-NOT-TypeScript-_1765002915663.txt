I want to add a small “Stories of change” carousel to the Home page with anonymized, one-line snapshots of how the tool helps people.

Important:
DO NOT run any e2e tests for this change. Manual/component-level checks only.

Business requirement – Story snapshot carousel

Add a new section to the Home page that:

Shows anonymized, hopeful story snippets

Content examples (you can tweak but keep tone):

“I used to panic when employers asked about my record. Now I have three honest ways to respond.”

“I turned a terrifying letter into a clear, professional response.”

“For the first time, I feel ready to explain my past and my growth.”

No names or identifying data; if you label them, use things like:

“Job seeker, tech support”

“Retail candidate”

“First-time applicant after reentry”

Carousel behavior

Show one card at a time (or 1–2 on desktop), with:

A short headline or tag (like “Job seeker, hospitality”).

The one-sentence quote.

Carousel should:

Auto-advance every ~4–6 seconds with a fade/slide transition.

Include manual controls:

Left/right arrows and/or small dot indicators.

Pause auto-advance on hover (desktop), and resume when hover ends.

Tone & visual style

Cards should:

Use soft backgrounds and rounded corners.

Feel intimate and respectful, not like hypey testimonials.

Text should be easy to read (no long paragraphs).

Accessibility & motion

Users must be able to manually navigate via buttons.

Indicators should be keyboard-focusable.

For prefers-reduced-motion:

Disable sliding animation; perform instant changes or simple fades.

Acceptance criteria
Scenario: Carousel shows rotating story snapshots

Given the user scrolls to the Stories section

When they watch for several seconds

Then:

The card automatically cycles through different anonymized one-sentence stories with a subtle transition.

Scenario: Manual navigation works

Given the user sees the carousel

When they click left/right controls or dots

Then:

The displayed story changes to the corresponding slide.

Auto-advance should continue (or resume) after manual navigation, unless you intentionally pause it for a period.

Scenario: Respectful and hopeful tone

Given the user reads the cards

When they scan the text

Then:

Language feels supportive, non-shaming, and realistic.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the Home layout and determine where to place the carousel (likely below How It Works and/or Safe Zone).

Describe your understanding of the requirements (one-sentence stories, anonymized, rotating).

Key considerations

Keep performance good; use lightweight state for currentIndex.

Make controls accessible (ARIA labels, focus visible).

Implementation plan

Step 1: Create a stories array with { role, quote }.

Step 2: Build a small carousel component with currentIndex state and setInterval or setTimeout for auto-advance.

Step 3: Add fade/slide transitions with Tailwind (e.g., transition-opacity, translate-x-*).

Step 4: Add left/right buttons and dot indicators.

Step 5: Handle prefers-reduced-motion by simplifying transitions.

Skeleton

const stories = [
  {
    role: "Job seeker, retail",
    quote:
      "I used to panic when employers asked about my record. Now I have three honest ways to respond.",
  },
  {
    role: "First-time applicant after reentry",
    quote:
      "I turned a terrifying letter into a clear, professional response.",
  },
  {
    role: "Job seeker, tech support",
    quote:
      "For the first time, I feel ready to explain my past and my growth.",
  },
];

function StoriesCarousel() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  // interval + handlers, etc.

  return (
    <section className="px-4 py-10">
      <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto text-center mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">Stories of change</h2>
