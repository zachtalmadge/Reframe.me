I want to add a dedicated “Safe space / Privacy & Safety” block on the Home page that clearly communicates:

This is a judgement-free tool

How we treat privacy and data

That they’re in control

It should feel warm, reassuring, and serious about privacy.

Important:
DO NOT perform any e2e tests for this. Manual/component-level checks only.

Business requirement – Dedicated safe-zone section

Add a new section on the Home page that:

Communicates safety, privacy, and control

Suggested content (you can polish but keep meaning):

Heading: “A judgement-free space, built for your reality.”

Subtext:

“We don’t store what you write in this session. You decide what to share, and you can close this tab at any time.”

Bullets or short list:

“No account required.”

“No tracking of your answers.”

“You control what you keep, copy, or delete.”

Uses a warm, reassuring visual style

A rounded, card-like block with:

Soft background (e.g., a tinted neutral or orange-secondary with low opacity).

A simple icon (lock, shield, or heart-lock) that feels protective, not scary.

Optional micro-motion:

A very subtle pulse or glow on the icon when the section scrolls into view (once, not looping forever).

Placement

Place this section:

Below the hero/feature cards but above any heavy content (like How It Works or carousels), OR

Just under the main CTA to catch users early.

It should be clearly visible without feeling like a “legal disclaimer.”

Acceptance criteria
Scenario: Safe-zone block is visible and clearly about privacy

Given the user is on the Home page

When they scroll a little past the hero or CTA

Then:

They see a clearly labeled safe-zone block explaining:

Judgement-free nature.

Privacy behavior.

User control.

Scenario: Visual style feels warm and reassuring

Given the user views the section

When they look at the icon and colors

Then:

Colors are soft, readable, and consistent with the brand (e.g., orange secondary or warm neutral).

Icon feels protective (lock/heart/shield), not punitive.

Scenario: Optional micro-motion is subtle

Given the user scrolls the section into view

When any icon or background motion occurs

Then:

It is gentle (e.g., a small pulse or fade) and runs once.

It does not distract from reading the text.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess Home layout

Find the right place in the Home component to insert this block (likely after hero/feature cards).

Describe your understanding

Confirm you’ll create a single, dedicated section about privacy/safety, with warm styling and optional subtle icon motion.

Key considerations

Keep:

Copy empathetic and trauma-informed.

Layout mobile-first with good padding and line-height.

High contrast and accessible font sizes.

Implementation plan

Step 1: Add a new <section> with max-w-* container, padding, and rounded background.

Step 2: Add an icon + heading + subcopy + 2–3 bullet points.

Step 3: Optionally add a small animation on icon when section enters view (using useInView or a simple useEffect).

Step 4: Verify spacing with adjacent sections on mobile and desktop.

Prompt 35 – Add “Stories of Change” Snapshot Carousel

I want to add a small “Stories of change” carousel to the Home page with anonymized, one-line snapshots of how the tool helps people.
