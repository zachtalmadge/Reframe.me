Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page currently includes a “Safe space / privacy” section rendered with a card-like layout (Shield icon, headline “A judgement-free space, built for your reality.”, bullets about no account, no tracking, etc.).

Right now, that safe-space card is static:

It does not share the hover / interactive effects used by the elements above it on the page (e.g., lift, subtle shadow, border glow, or scale that those cards might use).

The text does not have any “shine” / shimmer effect on hover.

I want you to:

Make this safe-space card feel consistent with the interactive cards above it (same or very similar hover animation style).

Add a subtle left-to-right “shine” effect that ripples through the headline and key text when the user hovers/focuses the section – in a way that’s gentle, not flashy, and still trauma-aware.

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

The current component looks like this:

<section
  className="py-10 md:py-14 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"
  aria-labelledby="safe-space-heading"
  data-testid="section-safe-space"

Business requirement – Safe-space card hover + text shine

Update this safe-space / privacy section so that:

The outer card (the div with rounded-xl border bg-chart-2/5 p-6 md:p-8) has matching hover/interactivity with the cards above it on the page, for example:

Slight lift (translate-y / shadow) or border accent on hover.

Smooth transition for transform/opacity/shadow.

Any subtle glow or outline used by the feature cards, so the safe-space block feels like part of the same family.

The text shine effect:

On hover or focus of the card/section, a subtle shimmer/shine passes from left to right over:

At minimum, the headline “A judgement-free space, built for your reality.”

Ideally also (gently) over the short paragraph or the bullet list text, if that can be done without visual clutter.

The shine should feel:

Soft and slow – not strobe-like or aggressive.

In line with the app’s trauma-aware tone (no harsh flashing).

Implementation notes:

Use Tailwind + simple CSS keyframes / utilities as appropriate (e.g., via a group wrapper and pseudo-element or gradient overlay) to create the shine.

Respect any existing “reduce motion” patterns in the codebase if present (e.g., disable or soften the animation for users with prefers-reduced-motion).

Keep the text fully readable during the shine, with adequate contrast.

Do not change:

The actual text content (copy) of the heading, paragraph, or bullets.

The semantic structure (<section>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <li>).

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Safe-space card has consistent hover behavior

Given the user is on the page containing the safe-space section

When they move their pointer over the safe-space card (or focus it via keyboard if applicable)

Then:

The card exhibits a similar hover animation to the elements above it (e.g., gentle lift/scale, border/shadow transition).

The animation feels smooth and subtle, not jittery or abrupt.

The visual style clearly matches the interactive pattern used by the other feature/hero cards above it.

Scenario: Text shine effect triggers on hover

Given the user moves their pointer over the safe-space card

When the hover state begins

Then:

A left-to-right text shine effect appears across the main text (at least the heading), creating a brief, soft shimmer.

The text remains readable and does not become obscured.

The shine is not overly bright or harsh.

Scenario: Shine effect is not overwhelming

Given the user repeatedly enters and leaves the safe-space card with their pointer

When the shine animation plays

Then:

The animation duration and intensity remain comfortable (no rapid flashing).

The effect feels like a gentle highlight, not a distracting light show.

If there is any support for reduced-motion in the app, the shine effect honors it (e.g., reduced or disabled if prefers-reduced-motion is set).

Scenario: No regressions to structure or content

Given the existing content and layout of the safe-space section

When the hover and shine effects are added

Then:

The copy (“A judgement-free space…” and the privacy bullets) is unchanged.

The section still uses the same landmarks and aria attributes (aria-labelledby="safe-space-heading").

Responsive behavior (stacked layout on mobile, side-by-side on larger screens) remains intact.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current interactive patterns above this section

Locate the “elements above it” on the page (e.g., feature cards or other interactive blocks that already have hover animations).

Identify:

How those cards are structured (e.g., wrapper div with group class).

Which Tailwind classes or custom utilities are used for:

Hover lift (transform, translate-y, shadow).

Gradients or borders.

Transition durations and easing.

Determine the best way to reuse or mirror those patterns for the safe-space card, so it feels consistent.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will add hover/interactive styles to the safe-space card that align with the other interactive cards on the page.

That you will implement a left-to-right text shine effect that runs on hover/focus of the card.

That the shine must be subtle, trauma-aware, and non-distracting.

That you will not change text content or semantic structure—only styling/animation.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

You don’t inadvertently remove or override existing spacing, colors, or layout.

The safe-space card remains fully accessible:

Text has sufficient contrast.

Headings and lists are preserved.

The shine effect:

Does not create a11y issues for users sensitive to motion.

Is implemented in a way that is performant (avoid overly heavy animations).

Confirm that any global group or hover-related classes you add do not collide with other parts of the page.

Propose best-practice implementation details

Describe how you will:

Wrap the inner card div in a Tailwind group so hover on the entire card can be used to trigger child animations.

Add hover classes: e.g. transition, duration-300, hover:-translate-y-0.5, hover:shadow-lg, or match existing patterns used by the other cards.

For the text shine effect, describe a possible approach, such as:

Using a CSS gradient mask / pseudo-element over the text.

Adding a relative overflow-hidden wrapper around text, and a child span that:

Has a gradient background.

Animates translate-x from left to right on group-hover.

Uses mix-blend or opacity to create a subtle highlight.

Or using a keyframes animation (e.g. shine keyframes) tied to a group-hover class.

Mention how you’ll keep it subtle (e.g., light opacity, limited repeat, moderate duration).

Assess other best practices

Tailwind:

Use utility classes consistent with the rest of the codebase (no bespoke inline style blobs unless necessary).

Motion:

Consider adding a motion-safe: prefix if the project already uses prefers-reduced-motion.

UX & tone:

The hover/shine effect should feel like a gentle signpost that this area is important and safe, not a flashy marketing card.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Inspect the card/feature components above the safe-space section to identify their hover/interactive Tailwind class patterns.

Step 2: Update the safe-space card’s outer div to:

Use group and appropriate transition, transform, shadow, and border classes to match the other cards.

Step 3: Wrap the heading and/or text in a container that:

Is relative and overflow-hidden.

Supports adding a shine overlay element.

Step 4: Add the shine implementation:

Either through Tailwind-compatible classes and a span overlay.

Or by adding a small CSS module / global style with a @keyframes shine and referencing it via className.

Step 5: Tie the shine’s animation start to the card’s group-hover (and optionally focus-within) state.

Step 6: Manually verify on mobile and desktop:

Safe-space card now hovers similarly to other cards.

Shine effect runs once or in a subtle way on hover/focus, and text remains readable.

Step 7: Confirm no layout regressions or console warnings/errors.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the text/copy of the safe-space section.

Modify unrelated sections (other cards, forms, results pages).

Alter global typography or color tokens.

Only:

Adjust the safe-space section’s styles/animations and any minimal shared CSS needed for the shine effect.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example (in JavaScript React, not TypeScript) showing how the card and text shine might be wired, e.g.:

<section
  className="py-10 md:py-14 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"
  aria-labelledby="safe-space-heading"
  data-testid="section-safe-space"
>
  <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    <div className="relative group rounded-xl border border-chart-2/20 bg-chart-2/5 p-6 md:p-8 transition-transform duration-300 ease-out hover:-translate-y-0.5 hover:shadow-lg">
      <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-6 items-start">
        <div className="flex-shrink-0">
          <div className="w-12 h-12 rounded-lg bg-chart-2/10 flex items-center justify-center">
            <Shield className="w-6 h-6 text-chart-2" aria-hidden="true" />
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <div className="relative overflow-hidden">
              <h2
                id="safe-space-heading"
                className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground"
              >
                A judgement-free space, built for your reality.
              </h2>
              {/* Shine overlay span; actual implementation may use keyframes/gradient */}
              <span
                aria-hidden="true"
                className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 translate-x-[-100%] bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-white/30 to-transparent opacity-0 transition group-hover:opacity-100 group-hover:translate-x-full"
              />
            </div>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We don't store what you write in this session. You decide what to share, and you can close this tab at any time.
            </p>
          </div>
          {/* ...rest of content unchanged... */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


This is only a conceptual skeleton; in the actual implementation you can refine class names, durations, and shine effect to align with the existing design system and animation patterns.
