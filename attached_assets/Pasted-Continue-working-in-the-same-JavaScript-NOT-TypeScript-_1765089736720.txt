Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
On the Home page, the hero is followed by two main feature cards that describe the core tools:

“5 Disclosure Narratives”

“Pre-Adverse Action Response”

I want to introduce a section heading labeled “What we offer” that appears right below the hero and above these two main cards, clearly framing them as the primary features of Reframe.me.

Important:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Add “What we offer” heading above feature cards

Update the Home page layout so that:

A “What we offer” heading appears:

Immediately below the hero section,

Above the two main feature cards (“5 Disclosure Narratives” and “Pre-Adverse Action Response”).

The heading should:

Be visually clear and prominent (e.g., text-xl–text-2xl, font-semibold or similar).

Use styling consistent with other section titles on the page (e.g., centered or left-aligned based on your existing convention, same max-w container).

Optionally include a short, muted subtitle line if needed (you can put placeholder copy; I can refine later), but the main requirement is the “What we offer” heading itself.

The heading should group the two feature cards logically, so it reads as:

Hero → “What we offer” heading → 2 main feature cards.

Make sure spacing between:

the bottom of the hero,

the new “What we offer” heading, and

the feature cards
is balanced and not overly large, especially on mobile.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: “What we offer” appears above the feature cards

Given the user is on the Home page

When they scroll just below the hero

Then:

They see a clear heading that reads “What we offer”.

Directly under this heading, they see the two main feature cards for:

“5 Disclosure Narratives”

“Pre-Adverse Action Response”

Scenario: Spacing and hierarchy are clean

Given the hero and feature cards were already present

When the “What we offer” heading is added

Then:

There is no awkward large gap between the hero and the heading, nor between the heading and the cards.

The visual hierarchy is clear:

Hero → section heading (“What we offer”) → feature cards.

Scenario: No regressions to card behavior

Given the feature cards already have hover/interaction behavior

When the heading is added above them

Then:

The cards’ animations, hover effects, and click behavior remain unchanged.

No layout or responsiveness issues are introduced on mobile or desktop.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Home page structure

Locate:

The hero component/section.

The two main feature cards (“5 Disclosure Narratives” and “Pre-Adverse Action Response”) and their wrapper/container.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain that:

You will insert a “What we offer” heading between the hero and the feature cards.

The heading will visually match existing section titles and sit in the same container as the cards (or in a parent container that wraps both heading and cards).

You will adjust spacing so the section feels cohesive and clean.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

You do not modify the internal logic or interactivity of the feature cards.

You keep mobile-first spacing (e.g., using mt-* and mb-* judiciously).

The new heading uses consistent typography with other section headings (e.g., Safe-space, How It Works).

Propose best-practice implementation details

Wrap the feature cards and heading in a shared layout container, for example:

<section className="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 mt-10">
  <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto">
    <h2 className="text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground">
      What we offer
    </h2>
    {/* Optional short subtitle in muted text, if desired */}
    {/* <p className="mt-2 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Placeholder subtitle copy...
    </p> */}

    <div className="mt-6 grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2">
      {/* Existing “5 Disclosure Narratives” card */}
      {/* Existing “Pre-Adverse Action Response” card */}
    </div>
  </div>
</section>


Ensure the mt-* between hero → this section, and heading → cards is tuned so it doesn’t feel cramped or too loose.

Generate a step-by-step plan

Step 1: Open the Home page component where the hero and main feature cards are rendered.

Step 2: Identify the container currently holding the two cards and wrap/add a section or div that includes a new <h2> heading "What we offer".

Step 3: Apply Tailwind classes to:

Align with global layout (max-w-*, mx-auto, px-*).

Style the heading as a section title (text-xl+ and font-semibold).

Step 4: Adjust margins (mt-*) so that:

The hero flows naturally into this new section.

The heading flows naturally into the cards.

Step 5: Manually verify on mobile and desktop that:

The heading appears correctly.

The cards are directly under it.

There are no regressions in card behavior or layout.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the content of the feature cards.

Edit hero copy or rotating text.

Only:

Add the “What we offer” heading and adjust layout around the existing feature cards.

For this prompt, do not run e2e tests. Use only local/component-level checks; I’ll verify the final layout in the UI myself.
