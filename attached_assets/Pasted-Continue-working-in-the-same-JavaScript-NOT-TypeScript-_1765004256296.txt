Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
On the Home page, there is an existing Get Started CTA section in the middle of the page (between other sections), with this structure:

<section
  className="py-10 md:py-14 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8"
  aria-labelledby="cta-heading"
>
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center space-y-6">
    <h2 id="cta-heading" className="sr-only">
      Get Started
    </h2>

    <Link href="/selection">
      <Button
        size="lg"
        className="group w-full sm:w-auto min-h-[48px] px-8 text-lg font-medium shadow-md"
        data-testid="button-get-started"
      >
        Get Started
        <span className="inline-flex transition-transform duration-150 ease-out group-hover:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible:translate-x-1 motion-reduce:transform-none">
          <ArrowRight className="w-5 h-5" aria-hidden="true" />
        </span>
      </Button>
    </Link>

    <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
      Your information stays private and is not stored after your session.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>


This mid-page CTA + disclaimer should stay as-is.
Now I want to also add a new Get Started CTA at the bottom of the hero section, inside the hero’s gradient container, without the disclaimer under it.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – New hero CTA (no disclaimer) + keep existing mid-page CTA (with disclaimer)

Update the Home page so that:

Hero CTA inside hero container, no disclaimer

Add a new Get Started CTA button at the bottom of the hero content, rendered inside the hero’s main container, so it sits visually on top of the gradient background.

This hero CTA should:

Use the same Link href="/selection" and Button styling/microinteractions as the existing mid-page CTA.

NOT render the disclaimer paragraph underneath.

Be placed within the hero’s relative gradient wrapper, below the hero heading/subcopy.

Mid-page CTA remains unchanged (with disclaimer)

The existing mid-page CTA section (the snippet above) should:

Remain where it is in the layout (middle of the page).

Keep its disclaimer text exactly as:

“Your information stays private and is not stored after your session.”

Do not remove or alter this disclaimer under the mid-page CTA.

Behavior stays consistent

Both CTAs:

Navigate to the same route (/selection) when clicked.

Use the same Button component styling and microinteractions (hover arrow movement, press scale, etc.).

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Hero CTA appears inside gradient, with no disclaimer

Given the user loads the Home page

When they view the hero section at the top

Then:

They see a Get Started button positioned inside the hero content area, visually on top of the gradient background.

There is no disclaimer text directly under this hero CTA button.

Scenario: Mid-page CTA still shows disclaimer

Given the user scrolls down to the existing mid-page CTA section

When they view this section

Then:

They see the Get Started button with the disclaimer text:

“Your information stays private and is not stored after your session.”

The structure and styling of this mid-page CTA + disclaimer is unchanged from the current version.

Scenario: Both CTAs behave identically on click

Given both Get Started buttons are visible (hero and mid-page)

When the user clicks either of them

Then:

They are navigated to the same destination (/selection or the existing selection flow).

No other logic or flow is changed.

Scenario: Layout remains clean and responsive

Given the Home page is viewed on mobile and desktop

When the user looks at the hero and mid-page sections

Then:

The hero CTA is nicely aligned inside the hero container, with comfortable spacing from the hero text.

The mid-page CTA remains in its current spot with its disclaimer intact.

Nothing overlaps or looks cramped at different breakpoints.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the hero component and current CTA section

Locate:

The hero section component (with the gradient background and main headline/subcopy).

The current mid-page CTA section (the snippet provided above).

Identify:

The main hero content container (likely a div inside a section with gradient classes and relative positioning).

Confirm that the mid-page CTA is currently placed outside the hero, as its own section.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

You will add a new Get Started CTA inside the hero container (no disclaimer).

You will keep the existing mid-page CTA + disclaimer exactly as is.

Both CTAs will share the same link and button behavior.

Identify key considerations to avoid breaking anything

Ensure:

You do not remove or alter the mid-page CTA’s disclaimer.

You do not change the /selection link behavior.

The hero CTA is positioned so it doesn’t collide with or obscure hero text, especially on smaller screens.

Propose implementation (React + Tailwind)

Inside the hero component, at the bottom of the content block, add a CTA block without the disclaimer:

<div className="mt-6 text-center sm:text-left">
  <Link href="/selection">
    <Button
      size="lg"
      className="group w-full sm:w-auto min-h-[48px] px-8 text-lg font-medium shadow-md"
      data-testid="button-get-started-hero"
    >
      Get Started
      <span className="inline-flex transition-transform duration-150 ease-out group-hover:translate-x-1 group-focus-visible:translate-x-1 motion-reduce:transform-none">
        <ArrowRight className="w-5 h-5" aria-hidden="true" />
      </span>
    </Button>
  </Link>
</div>


Leave the existing mid-page CTA section exactly as it is now (button + disclaimer), possibly just updating data-testid if you need to differentiate the two, but content and layout should match the snippet you provided.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum:

Step 1: Open the hero component and identify the main content container (the div that wraps hero heading/subcopy).

Step 2: Insert the new Link + Button block (without the <p> disclaimer) at the bottom of the hero content.

Step 3: Confirm that the hero CTA uses href="/selection" and the same Button styles as the mid-page CTA.

Step 4: Leave the existing mid-page CTA <section> with its <p> disclaimer unchanged.

Step 5: Manually test:

Confirm the hero CTA appears inside the hero gradient (top of page), with no disclaimer beneath it.

Confirm the mid-page CTA still appears in the middle of the page with its disclaimer line.

Confirm both buttons navigate correctly.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the disclaimer text content or remove it from the mid-page CTA.

Modify the /selection route, flow, or any form logic.

Only adjust:

The addition of a new hero CTA (no disclaimer).

The placement of that hero CTA inside the hero container.

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the Hero component and, if needed, minor details around the mid-page CTA section.

You may perform manual or component-level checks only.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
