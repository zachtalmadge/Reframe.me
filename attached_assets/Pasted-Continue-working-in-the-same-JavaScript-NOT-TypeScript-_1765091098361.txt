Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page currently includes, among other sections:

Hero (headline, subheading, CTA, before/after text)

Main feature cards (“5 Disclosure Narratives” and “Pre-Adverse Action Response”)

How It Works section (3 steps)

Safe-space / privacy block

Stories of Change carousel

An orange-accented “Is this for me?” strip that we recently added, which currently appears below the Stories of Change section.

I now want to change the placement of the “Is this for me?” section:

It should be moved so that it appears above the How It Works section on the Home page.

The content and styling of “Is this for me?” (orange card, “Reframe.me might help if…”, “This is not…”) should remain the same—this is just a layout reordering, not a content change.

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Reorder Home page so “Is this for me?” sits above How It Works

Update the Home page layout so that:

The “Is this for me?” section:

No longer appears under / after Stories of Change.

Is rendered above the How It Works section.

The new approximate vertical order (ignoring minor sections) should be:

Hero

Main feature cards (“What we offer” area)

“Is this for me?” section (orange informational strip)

How It Works

Safe-space / privacy block

Stories of Change

(Footer and anything else below)

The content and styling of the “Is this for me?” section must not change:

Heading: “Is this for me?”

Orange-accented card, “Reframe.me might help if…” bullets, and “This is not:” bullets.

Same Tailwind classes / design tokens used for its orange styling (unless you need tiny spacing tweaks to fit the new placement).

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: “Is this for me?” is above How It Works

Given the user scrolls down the Home page from the hero

When they pass the main feature cards / “What we offer” area

Then:

They see the “Is this for me?” section next.

Below that section, they see the How It Works section (3-step explanation).

Scenario: “Is this for me?” is no longer below Stories of Change

Given the previous design placed “Is this for me?” under Stories of Change

When the new layout is in place

Then:

The Stories of Change section no longer has the “Is this for me?” block directly under it.

The next content after Stories of Change is whatever normally follows (e.g., footer), not the orange “Is this for me?” card.

Scenario: Content and styling of “Is this for me?” remain intact

Given the “Is this for me?” strip was already implemented with orange styling and specific content

When its position is updated

Then:

The heading, bullet text, orange colors, and card layout remain unchanged (aside from small spacing adjustments if needed).

It still has:

“Reframe.me might help if…” bullets

“This is not:” bullets (not legal advice, no hiring guarantees, not a replacement for professional help)

Scenario: No regressions to How It Works or Stories of Change

Given the How It Works and Stories of Change sections were previously working and animated correctly

When the “Is this for me?” section is moved

Then:

How It Works still displays and animates as before.

Stories of Change still displays and functions as before.

No layout or responsiveness issues are introduced on mobile or desktop.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Home page section order

Locate the Home page component where sections are rendered in order (hero, feature cards, How It Works, Safe-space, Stories of Change, “Is this for me?”, etc.).

Identify:

The JSX block for the IsThisForMe section (or equivalent component).

The JSX block for the How It Works section.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will move the “Is this for me?” section so it is rendered above the How It Works section.

That you will not change the inner content or styling of the “Is this for me?” component, except possibly minor mt/mb spacing adjustments to keep things visually balanced in its new location.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

You only reorder the sections in the render tree; do not alter shared layout wrappers that could break other sections.

You keep consistent horizontal padding and max-w-* containers so the new order still looks cohesive.

You don’t accidentally duplicate or remove the “Is this for me?” section—there should be exactly one instance.

Propose best-practice implementation details

At a high level:

In the Home page JSX, cut the IsThisForMe section (or equivalent JSX) from its current position under Stories of Change.

Paste it so it appears immediately before the How It Works section.

If necessary, adjust top margins (e.g., mt-10, py-10) so the transitions between:

Feature cards → Is this for me → How It Works
look balanced and not too crowded or too spaced out.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this change

At a minimum include:

Open the Home page component file.

Find the IsThisForMe (or equivalent) section and confirm it is currently rendered below the Stories of Change section.

Move that section’s JSX so it is rendered between the feature cards and the How It Works section (or, more specifically, above the How It Works JSX block).

Review margins between:

The bottom of the feature cards section and “Is this for me?”.

The bottom of “Is this for me?” and the top of How It Works.
Adjust mt-* / py-* if needed for consistent visual rhythm.

Verify on mobile and desktop that:

The order is now: hero → features → Is this for me → How It Works → Safe-space → Stories of Change → footer.

The “Is this for me?” card still looks correct and uses the same orange styling.

No other sections are broken or missing.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the text or styling inside the “Is this for me?” section.

Modify copy or layout in How It Works, Safe-space, or Stories of Change.

Only:

Reorder the placement of the “Is this for me?” component and adjust spacing as needed.

For this prompt, remember: do NOT run any e2e tests. You may do local/component-level checks only; I’ll verify the updated layout in the UI myself.
