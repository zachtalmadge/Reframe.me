Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
On the Home page, there are two main feature cards:

“5 Disclosure Narratives”

“Pre-Adverse Action Response”

Right now, these cards are static. I want them to feel more alive and “wow” while still staying calm and respectful of the user’s emotional state.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Interactive, animated feature cards (hover/tap states)

Enhance the two feature cards on the Home page with lightweight, delightful interactions:

Card hover/tap microinteraction

On desktop hover and mobile tap/focus:

Card should:

Slightly lift (translateY or scale) and gain a stronger shadow.

Maintain rounded corners and existing layout.

The card should feel like it’s “coming forward” but not bouncing around.

Icon animation

Each card has an icon (document icon for narratives, envelope icon for pre-adverse response).

On hover/tap/focus:

The icon should have a small, quick animation:

e.g., a subtle scale up or bounce (one-time, not infinite).

Animation must be gentle and not cartoonish.

Reveal a short, bold “emotional line” of copy

On hover/tap, under the existing description, show an additional one-line message that fades/slides into view, such as:

For narratives card:

“Show up prepared, not panicked.”

For response letter card:

“Turn a scary letter into a grounded response.”

This line should:

Be hidden by default.

Fade and/or slide in when the card is active (hover/tap/focus).

Use slightly bolder styling than the body text to stand out (but not as strong as the main heading).

Accessibility & mobile behavior

On mobile:

Tapping the card should still work as a selection/CTA as it does now.

The card’s “active” visual state (lift + extra line) should be visible on tap/focus.

For keyboard users:

When the card or its primary CTA receives focus, the same visual state/extra line should be shown.

Overall tone

Interactions should feel:

Smooth, modern, and encouraging, not loud or “salesy.”

Respectful of users who may be anxious or triggered by this topic.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Card hover/tap causes lift + shadow

Given the user is on the Home page

When they hover over a feature card on desktop or focus/tap it on mobile

Then:

The card slightly lifts (e.g., -translate-y-1 or scale-105) and gets a stronger shadow-lg or similar.

The animation is smooth (e.g., transition-transform, transition-shadow with ~150–200ms).

Scenario: Icon animates gently on interaction

Given the user hovers, focuses, or taps on a feature card

When the card enters its active state

Then:

The card’s icon performs a small, quick animation (scale/bounce) and then rests.

The animation is subtle and does not loop constantly while the pointer is idle.

Scenario: Extra emotional line appears on interaction

Given the user interacts with a feature card (hover/focus/tap)

When the card is active

Then:

A new, short line of copy appears beneath the existing description, with a fade/slide-in transition.

For narratives, text is similar to: “Show up prepared, not panicked.”

For response letter, text is similar to: “Turn a scary letter into a grounded response.”

When the card is no longer active, the extra line hides again.

Scenario: Mobile and keyboard users get the same experience

Given the user is on a mobile device or using the keyboard

When they tap or tab-focus onto a feature card

Then:

The card shows the same lifted state, icon animation, and extra line.

There is no loss of functionality (card still works as a CTA).

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Home page feature card implementation

Locate the component(s) that render the two main cards on the Home page (e.g., Home.tsx/Home.jsx, FeatureCard, etc.).

Identify:

Card container structure.

Icon elements.

Existing Tailwind classes for spacing, rounding, and shadows.

How click/selection is wired (e.g., onClick, wrapping link, etc.).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That we’re adding hover/tap/focus animations (lift + shadow).

That the icon should show a small, tasteful animation on interaction.

That a new line of text appears only when the card is active.

That accessibility and mobile support are important.

Identify key considerations to avoid breaking existing functionality

Ensure:

The cards still behave as links/CTAs exactly as before.

Animations remain performant and do not cause layout shifts.

Motion is not overwhelming (keep durations short and easing gentle).

Optional: consider respecting prefers-reduced-motion to reduce or disable animations for those users.

Propose best-practice UX + Tailwind implementation

For the card container:

Use Tailwind transitions like:

transition-transform transition-shadow duration-150 ease-out

Active state: -translate-y-1 shadow-lg or scale-[1.02].

For the icon:

Wrap in a container with transition-transform and apply a scale-105 or small translate on hover/focus.

For the extra line:

Use opacity-0 max-h-0 → opacity-100 max-h-[some] with transition-all and overflow-hidden or a simpler opacity + translate-y fade-in.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Add state or use CSS group hover/focus to determine when a card is “active.”

Step 2: Add Tailwind classes to the card container to lift + increase shadow on active.

Step 3: Add animation classes to the icon (e.g., slight scale) on card active state.

Step 4: Insert the extra one-line message in each card and hide it by default.

Step 5: Use group and group-hover, group-focus-within (and potentially group-active) to control the extra line’s visibility and transitions.

Step 6: Manually test:

Desktop hover.

Keyboard focus.

Mobile tap.

Ensure everything still navigates correctly.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change the overall layout of the Home page.

Modify headings, hero text, or CTA copy beyond the new one-line emotional messages in the cards.

Only adjust:

The two main feature cards on the Home page to add these interactions.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified JSX/Tailwind sketch for one card, for example:

<button
  type="button"
  className="group w-full rounded-xl border bg-white p-6 text-left shadow-sm transition-transform transition-shadow duration-150 ease-out hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-lg focus-visible:-translate-y-1 focus-visible:shadow-lg focus-visible:outline-none"
  onClick={handleSelectNarratives}
>
  <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
    <div className="flex h-10 w-10 items-center justify-center rounded-lg bg-emerald-50 transition-transform duration-150 group-hover:scale-105 group-focus-visible:scale-105">
      {/* icon */}
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 className="text-base font-semibold">5 Disclosure Narratives</h3>
      <p className="mt-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        You can generate five unique ways to discuss your background with
        potential employers…
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2 text-sm font-medium text-emerald-700 opacity-0 translate-y-1 transition-opacity transition-transform duration-150 group-hover:opacity-100 group-hover:translate-y-0 group-focus-visible:opacity-100 group-focus-visible:translate-y-0">
        Show up prepared, not panicked.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</button>


A similar pattern can be used for the Pre-Adverse Action Response card with different copy and icon.

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the Home page feature cards and any shared card component.

You may perform manual checks or small component-level tests.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
