Continue working in the same JavaScript + React + Tailwind, mobile-first project.
Implement the Selection Page that appears after the user clicks “Let’s Get Started” on the Home page.

Business requirement – Tool Selection

Create a Selection Page that lets users choose:

Narrative Generator

Pre-Adverse Action Response Letter

Both Documents

The page should prevent continuation until a choice is made and clearly show which option is selected.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)

Scenario: Selection required

Given the user has navigated from the Home page to the Selection Page

When the page loads

Then they see:

A title like “What would you like to create?”

Three large, tappable cards or radio-style options:

“Narrative Generator”

“Pre-Adverse Action Response”

“Both Documents”

A “Continue” button that is disabled until one option is selected

A “Back” link/button that returns to the Home page

Scenario: Option selected

Given the user is on the Selection Page

When they tap one of the three options

Then that option is visually highlighted (selected state), and the “Continue” button becomes enabled.

Scenario: Navigate to multi-step form

Given the user has selected an option and the Continue button is enabled

When they tap “Continue”

Then the app navigates to the Unified Multi-Step Form screen, passing along which option they chose ("narrative", "responseLetter", or "both").

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Please carry out the same checklist as in Prompt 1:

Assess the enhancement and determine the steps needed.

Describe your understanding of the requirements.

Call out key considerations to avoid disrupting the Home page and future steps.

Propose best-practice UX for this selection interaction (especially mobile).

Note other best practices (accessibility, keyboard navigation, focus state, Tailwind patterns).

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan.

Keep scope limited to the Selection Page + wiring to Multi-Step Form.

Propose the technical changes and show a skeleton of updated components/routes/state.

Do not modify files until I confirm. Output your understanding and plan first, then wait for my approval.
