Implement the Disclaimer / Acknowledgement modal that appears after documents are generated successfully, before users see or download them.

Business requirement – Legal/safety disclaimer

Before users access their generated narratives or letters, they must see a prominent disclaimer explaining:

Documents are AI-generated based on their input

This is not legal advice

They must review carefully and are responsible for final content

They are encouraged to consult trusted advisors/legal support

The modal must require explicit acknowledgment via checkbox before proceeding.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)

Scenario: Disclaimer must be acknowledged

Given the backend has returned a success or partial_fail response

When the frontend transitions from Loading to the next step

Then the user sees a modal overlay with:

Scrollable disclaimer text

A single checkbox labeled “I understand and agree”

A “Continue” button that is disabled until the checkbox is checked.

Scenario: Proceed to Documents Page

Given the disclaimer modal is visible

When the user checks the box and taps “Continue”

Then the modal closes and the Documents Page is shown.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Same pattern:

Assess the enhancement and describe steps for inserting the modal into the existing flow (Loading → Disclaimer → Documents Page).

Describe your understanding of the requirements and where disclaimer content should live (JSON/config vs inline).

Identify considerations:

Accessibility (focus trap, ESC behavior, keyboard navigation)

Ensuring users can’t bypass the modal

Propose best-practice UX for this kind of serious disclaimer in a supportive tone.

Note other best practices (reusability of modal component, Tailwind patterns).

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan and component structure (Modal, DisclaimerModal, state flags).

Keep scope limited to the modal and flow integration; do not change document generation logic.

Propose a skeleton showing where modal state is managed (e.g., in a parent “ResultsFlow” component).

Wait for my confirmation before editing.
