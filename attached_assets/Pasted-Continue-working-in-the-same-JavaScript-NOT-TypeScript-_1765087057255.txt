Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page hero is already implemented with:

A main headline and subheading (Reframe.me copy).

CTA button(s).

The rotating before/after text area with smooth fade-in, visible time, fade-out, and a gap between pairs.

I now want to add a subtle “spotlight” visual effect on the hero background that:

Follows the user’s mouse position when they move over the hero on desktop.

Feels like a soft, circular light or glow under the cursor.

Is gentle and low-contrast, not a harsh flashlight or strobe.

On mobile / touch devices, the effect can either:

Be disabled, or

Use a static, centered glow that doesn’t move with touch (whichever is simpler and more aligned with existing patterns).

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Soft spotlight following cursor over hero

Update the hero section so that:

When the user’s mouse is over the hero area on desktop:

A soft circular “spotlight” or glow appears under/around the cursor location.

The spotlight should:

Look like a subtle radial gradient (e.g., softer center, fading edges).

Use neutral colors consistent with the hero background (no harsh neon).

Be transparent enough that all text remains clearly readable.

As the user moves the mouse, the spotlight follows smoothly.

When the mouse leaves the hero:

The spotlight fades out or disappears gracefully.

On mobile / touch devices:

The effect should not cause janky scrolling or layout issues.

Acceptable behavior:

The spotlight is disabled, or

A static, gentle glow appears in a fixed position (e.g., center) and does not move with touch.

The effect must feel:

Calm, trauma-aware, and non-distracting.

No flickering, no aggressive flashing, no high-contrast “spotlight interrogation” vibe.

The hero content (headline, subheading, CTA, rotating before/after) should remain unchanged in layout and copy; only the background/overlay visuals are enhanced.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Spotlight appears and follows cursor on desktop

Given the user is on a desktop or laptop and hovers their mouse over the hero

When they move the cursor within the hero area

Then:

A soft circular glow appears around the cursor.

As they move, the glow follows their cursor smoothly.

The effect remains subtle; text remains readable at all times.

Scenario: Spotlight fades out when cursor leaves hero

Given the spotlight is visible because the user’s cursor is inside the hero

When the cursor leaves the hero area (e.g., moves above/below/outside the hero)

Then:

The spotlight fades out or disappears with a short, smooth transition.

No abrupt jump or harsh cutoff.

Scenario: Mobile behavior is safe and non-janky

Given the user is on a mobile or touch device

When they scroll or interact with the hero

Then:

The spotlight effect does not cause performance issues or jittery scrolling.

Either there is no moving spotlight, or a static, gentle glow that does not re-render on every touch move.

The hero text and buttons remain fully accessible.

Scenario: No regressions to hero content and animations

Given the hero previously had working:

Headline and subheading

CTA buttons

Rotating before/after text with smooth fade sequence

When the spotlight effect is added

Then:

All existing content and animation behavior remain intact.

Only the visual background gains the interactive spotlight overlay.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current hero component structure

Identify the hero component file (e.g., Hero.jsx or similar).

Locate the top-level container for the hero (the main <section> or wrapper div that spans the hero area).

Note:

Existing background styles (gradients, Tailwind classes).

How padding, max-width, and positioning are handled.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will add a mouse-position-driven spotlight overlay that appears when the cursor is over the hero and follows it.

That the spotlight will be implemented as a radial gradient overlay using absolute positioning and inline style or Tailwind-compatible utilities.

That the effect must be subtle, preserve text readability, and fade out when the mouse leaves.

That on mobile/touch, you will avoid expensive per-move updates and either disable the effect or use a static glow.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

The spotlight overlay is positioned inside the hero and does not interfere with clicks on buttons or links (use pointer-events-none on the overlay).

The effect performs well:

Avoid unnecessary state updates (e.g., throttle or keep the state minimal).

Use CSS transforms instead of reflow-heavy changes where possible.

The overlay’s z-index is high enough to be visible but below text / above background, or uses blend modes if appropriate.

The spotlight respects any design tokens and color system in use (no arbitrary colors that clash).

Propose best-practice implementation details

Describe a likely implementation:

Add state to the hero component:

const [spotlightPosition, setSpotlightPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
const [isSpotlightVisible, setIsSpotlightVisible] = useState(false);


Attach onMouseMove, onMouseEnter, and onMouseLeave handlers to the hero container:

On mouseMove, calculate relative coordinates within the hero (e.g., using getBoundingClientRect() and the event’s clientX, clientY), and update spotlightPosition.

On mouseEnter, set isSpotlightVisible to true.

On mouseLeave, set isSpotlightVisible to false.

Render a positioned overlay inside the hero:

<div
  aria-hidden="true"
  className={`pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 transition-opacity duration-300 ${
    isSpotlightVisible ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
  }`}
  style={{
    background: `radial-gradient(
      circle at ${spotlightPosition.x}px ${spotlightPosition.y}px,
      rgba(255,255,255,0.16),
      rgba(15,23,42,0.0) 55%
    )`,
  }}
/>


Use neutral colors and alpha values appropriate for your hero background (e.g., soft white/grey fading into your existing dark gradient).

Mention mobile behavior:

Option A: Wrap handlers in a useEffect that checks viewport width or navigator.userAgent and only attaches mouse handlers on non-touch devices.

Option B: Keep handlers but rely on the fact that touch doesn’t fire mousemove the same way; still ensure no weird side effects.

Assess other best practices

Performance:

Consider whether requestAnimationFrame is necessary; for most simple radial gradients, direct onMouseMove with light state updates may be enough.

Keep spotlightPosition as simple numbers and avoid re-computing heavy values.

Accessibility:

The spotlight overlay should be aria-hidden="true" and not affect tab order.

Text contrast must remain high enough even with the overlay present.

Design:

Use transition-opacity for fade-in/out of the whole overlay, not constant re-animation of the gradient.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Open the hero component file and locate the main hero wrapper <section> or <div>.

Step 2: Add state for spotlightPosition and isSpotlightVisible using React useState.

Step 3: Add ref to the hero container if needed, or use the event.currentTarget.getBoundingClientRect() to compute relative coordinates.

Step 4: Implement handleMouseMove, handleMouseEnter, handleMouseLeave functions to:

Update spotlightPosition in hero-local coordinates.

Toggle isSpotlightVisible on enter/leave.

Step 5: Inside the hero container, render an absolute, full-size overlay that:

Has pointer-events-none.

Uses a dynamic radial-gradient based on spotlightPosition.

Uses transition-opacity to fade in/out when isSpotlightVisible changes.

Step 6: Consider mobile behavior:

Ensure the spotlight doesn’t cause errors on touch devices.

Optionally add a mobile-specific class/condition to default the overlay to a subtle static gradient (or fully disable).

Step 7: Manually verify:

On desktop: moving the mouse over the hero shows a smooth spotlight that follows the cursor and fades out when leaving.

On mobile: no jittery behavior; hero remains performant and readable.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change hero copy (headline, subheading, CTA text).

Modify the rotating before/after logic or timing.

Alter other sections’ backgrounds or animations (Safe-space, How It Works, etc.).

Only:

Enhance the hero’s background with the cursor-following spotlight overlay and minimal supporting code.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example (in JavaScript React, not TypeScript) showing how the hero spotlight might be wired:

import { useRef, useState } from "react";

function Hero() {
  const heroRef = useRef(null);
  const [spotlightPosition, setSpotlightPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  const [isSpotlightVisible, setIsSpotlightVisible] = useState(false);

  const handleMouseMove = (event) => {
    const rect = heroRef.current?.getBoundingClientRect();
    if (!rect) return;

    const x = event.clientX - rect.left;
    const y = event.clientY - rect.top;

    setSpotlightPosition({ x, y });
  };

  const handleMouseEnter = () => {
    setIsSpotlightVisible(true);
  };

  const handleMouseLeave = () => {
    setIsSpotlightVisible(false);
  };

  return (
    <section
      ref={heroRef}
      className="relative overflow-hidden ..."
      onMouseMove={handleMouseMove}
      onMouseEnter={handleMouseEnter}
      onMouseLeave={handleMouseLeave}
    >
      {/* Spotlight overlay */}
      <div
        aria-hidden="true"
        className={`pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 transition-opacity duration-300 ${
          isSpotlightVisible ? "opacity-100" : "opacity-0"
        }`}
        style={{
          background: `radial-gradient(
            circle at ${spotlightPosition.x}px ${spotlightPosition.y}px,
            rgba(255,255,255,0.16),
            rgba(15,23,42,0.0) 55%
          )`,
        }}
      />

      {/* Existing hero content: gradient base, headline, subheading, CTA, rotating before/after... */}
    </section>
  );
}

export default Hero;


The final implementation should align with your existing hero layout and design tokens (e.g., base background colors and gradients).

Do not modify any files yet

First, output your understanding of this spotlight enhancement and your implementation plan.

Remember: do NOT perform any e2e tests for this change—I will manually confirm behavior.

Wait for my confirmation that your approach is sound before updating the code.
