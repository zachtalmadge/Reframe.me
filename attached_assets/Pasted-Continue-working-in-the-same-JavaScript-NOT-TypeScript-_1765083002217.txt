Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The existing Home page, Selection page, Unified Multi-Step Form, Loading screen, and Results/Documents page are already implemented and working, including:

Privacy-first behavior (refresh clears data and returns to Home).

Logo-click confirmation modal during the form/loading steps.

Clearing form data after a successful generation.

We now want to add a new informational page (e.g., /faq or /learn) that:

Uses an accordion-style FAQ UI to answer common questions.

Has no form inputs of its own (purely informational).

Is reachable from anywhere in the app (e.g., navbar, footer, or header link).

Important navigation requirement:
Navigating to this FAQ page from any part of the site during an active run (including the multi-step form and the document generation/loading flow) must result in form data being lost, just like when the user abandons the flow. This should be done in a way that is clear and trauma-aware (ideally using the same or similar confirmation pattern as the logo-click modal).

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Add a dedicated “Learn more / FAQ” page and wire it safely

Create and scaffold a FAQ / Learn more page so that:

There is a dedicated route (e.g., /faq or /learn) that shows:

A brief intro section explaining that this page provides general information only, not legal advice.

An accordion-style FAQ section where each question can be expanded/collapsed to show an answer.

Space for a prominent disclaimer block (content will be added in a later prompt).

A simple call-to-action at the bottom (e.g., “Ready to get started?” → /selection).

The accordion UI follows best-practice, accessible FAQ patterns:

Each FAQ item has a button for the question, with aria-expanded, aria-controls, and id attributes as appropriate.

The answer content is inside a region (<div> or <section>) linked via aria-controls.

The component is keyboard accessible (Enter/Space toggles open/closed).

Icons (e.g., chevron) give visual feedback and rotate on open/close.

Navigation behavior:

There is a consistent way to navigate to the FAQ page (e.g., a “Learn more” or “FAQ” link in the navbar or header).

If the user is in an active flow (e.g., mid-form or on the loading screen before results) and tries to navigate to FAQ:

They should be warned that they will lose their current answers/progress.

If they confirm, the app should:

Clear any in-progress form data/state.

Navigate to the FAQ page.

If they cancel, they remain on the current page and their data is preserved.

If the user is on the Home page or after a completed run (e.g., on the Results page where data has been cleared), clicking FAQ can navigate directly without an extra warning.

The FAQ page is mobile-first:

Content is vertically stacked with good spacing and readability on small screens.

Accordions are easy to tap and scroll through on mobile.

The page is purely informational:

No new forms, no inputs that store new user data.

It fits within the existing layout (using existing layout components if appropriate).

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: FAQ page is accessible from anywhere

Given the app is running and the user sees the main navigation

When they click a “Learn more” / “FAQ” link

Then they are routed to the new FAQ page (e.g., /faq or /learn).

Scenario: Accordion behavior and accessibility

Given the user is on the FAQ page

When they see the list of FAQ questions

Then:

Each question is a focusable button (or similar control) that can be toggled open/closed.

Pressing Enter/Space on a focused question toggles its expanded state.

When a question is expanded, its aria-expanded is true and the corresponding answer content is visible.

When collapsed, aria-expanded is false and the answer content is hidden.

The layout is usable on mobile and desktop without horizontal scroll.

Scenario: Navigating to FAQ during active form clears data (with warning)

Given the user is in the multi-step form or on the loading screen with partially completed data

When they click the “Learn more / FAQ” link

Then:

They see a trauma-aware confirmation modal/message indicating that navigating away will lose their current information.

If they confirm:

The form data is cleared.

They are navigated to the FAQ page.

If they cancel:

They remain on the form/loading page.

Their data is untouched.

Scenario: Navigating to FAQ after a completed run

Given the user has successfully generated narratives/letter and is on the Results/Documents page

When they click the FAQ link

Then:

They are taken to the FAQ page.

There is no need to preserve previous form data (it has already been cleared after generation according to existing app behavior).

Scenario: No regressions to existing flows

Given the existing flows (Home → Selection → Form → Loading → Results) are working

When the FAQ page and navigation link are added

Then:

The Home, Selection, Form, Loading, and Results pages remain functional and reachable as before.

The logo-click behavior and refresh behavior (data clearing) remain unchanged.

No new errors are introduced in routing or layout.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and current routing/layout

Identify how routing is currently set up using wouter (e.g., main router component, routes for Home, Selection, Form, Loading, and Results).

Identify the layout structure that should wrap the new FAQ page (e.g., shared <Layout> component, navbar, footer).

Determine where the “Learn more / FAQ” link should live (e.g., navbar, header, or a shared navigation component).

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will create a new FAQ / Learn more page route with an accordion UI for questions/answers.

That the page is informational only, with no user data inputs.

That the navigation to this page should be accessible from anywhere in the app.

That if the user tries to go to FAQ while in an active run (form or loading), they must be warned and given a choice before their data is cleared and they are navigated there.

That the implementation should be mobile-first, accessible, and consistent with the existing design.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

Existing routes and flows are not broken by adding the new FAQ route and navigation link.

The new “leave current flow” logic for navigating to FAQ reuses or aligns with the existing confirm-and-clear pattern used for the logo click during the form/loading stages.

Keyboard and screen reader accessibility are preserved in the accordion UI (aria attributes, focus order).

No new data persistence is introduced; navigating to FAQ during an active flow appropriately clears in-progress data only after user confirmation.

Propose best-practice implementation for the FAQ UI

Describe how you will structure:

The FAQ page component (e.g., FaqPage.jsx).

The accordion, possibly as a reusable FaqAccordion / AccordionItem component.

Outline Tailwind patterns conceptually:

Container classes (max-w-xl/max-w-2xl, centered content).

Spacing (px-4, py-8/py-12 for mobile, larger on desktop).

Borders/dividers for questions, transition classes for smooth open/close.

Explain how you will handle:

aria-expanded, aria-controls, id on buttons and panels.

Chevron icon rotation (e.g., using conditional transform rotate-180).

Explain how the warning-confirmation behavior for navigating to FAQ will integrate with existing state management for form data.

Assess other best practices

Tailwind usage:

Use utility classes for layout, spacing, typography, and transitions consistent with the rest of the app.

Accessibility:

Semantic structure (<main>, <section>, headings).

Proper aria attributes for accordions.

Clear focus outline for interactive elements.

UX:

Ensure the page feels calm and supportive, not overwhelming (no massive walls of text; answers will be added in the next prompt).

Performance:

Keep the accordion implementation lightweight (no heavy external libraries unless they are already part of the project).

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Add a new route for the FAQ page in the main router (e.g., /faq or /learn).

Step 2: Create a new FAQ page component with:

Intro text area.

Placeholder for a prominent disclaimer block.

Accordion container section.

Step 3: Implement an accessible accordion component or pattern that:

Maintains open/closed state per question.

Uses appropriate aria attributes and keyboard interactions.

Step 4: Add a “Learn more” / “FAQ” link to the shared navigation (e.g., navbar).

Step 5: Integrate navigation logic such that:

If the user is in an active run (form/loading), clicking FAQ triggers the same or similar confirmation pattern as the logo click.

On confirmation, clear form data and navigate to FAQ.

On cancel, remain in place.

Step 6: Manually verify:

FAQ page renders correctly on mobile and desktop.

Accordion toggles with mouse and keyboard.

Navigation to FAQ works from Home, Selection, Form, Loading, and Results with appropriate warning/clearing behavior.

Step 7: Confirm no regressions in main flows.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Modify the core logic of form steps, loading, or results beyond what’s necessary for navigation/warning when going to FAQ.

Implement the actual FAQ question/answer text yet (that will come in a separate prompt).

Only:

Add the FAQ page scaffold, accordion UI shell, navigation link, and the necessary data-clearing/warning behavior for navigating there.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified skeleton of how the FAQ page and accordion might look (in JavaScript React, not TypeScript), for example:

import { useState } from "react";

const faqs = [
  { id: "when-disclose", question: "When should I disclose my record?", answer: "" },
  { id: "pre-adverse-rights", question: "What are my rights during a pre-adverse action notice?", answer: "" },
  // Answers will be populated in a later prompt
];

function FaqPage() {
  const [openId, setOpenId] = useState(null);

  return (
    <main className="min-h-screen px-4 py-10">
      <section className="mx-auto max-w-2xl">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Learn more / FAQ</h1>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-700">
          This page shares general information only. It is not legal advice, and we cannot
          guarantee any hiring outcome. Always talk with a trusted person and, when you can,
          a legal professional about your situation.
        </p>

        {/* Prominent disclaimer block placeholder */}

        <div className="mt-8 space-y-4">
          {faqs.map((item) => {
            const isOpen = openId === item.id;
            return (
              <div key={item.id} className="border rounded-xl">
                <button
                  type="button"
                  className="flex w-full items-center justify-between px-4 py-3 text-left"
                  aria-expanded={isOpen}
                  aria-controls={`${item.id}-panel`}
                  onClick={() => setOpenId(isOpen ? null : item.id)}
                >
                  <span className="font-medium text-sm">{item.question}</span>
                  <span
                    className={`transition-transform ${isOpen ? "rotate-180" : ""}`}
                    aria-hidden="true"
                  >
                    ˅
                  </span>
                </button>
                {isOpen && (
                  <div
                    id={`${item.id}-panel`}
                    className="px-4 pb-4 text-sm text-slate-700"
                  >
                    {/* Answer text will be added in a later prompt */}
                  </div>
                )}
              </div>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
  );
}

export default FaqPage;


This skeleton is only to illustrate structure and approach; align the final implementation with the project’s existing layout and navigation patterns.

Do not modify any files yet

First, output your understanding of this FAQ-page scaffold and accordion UI, plus your implementation plan.

Remember: do NOT perform any e2e tests for this change—I will manually confirm behavior.

Wait for my confirmation that your approach is sound before updating the code.
