Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Selection page currently allows users to choose between:

Narrative Generator

Pre-Adverse Action Response Letter

Both

Then they tap Continue to go to the multi-step form. Right now, there is no persistent UX message warning about privacy or the impact of refreshing the page.

I want to add a non-dismissible privacy alert that appears as soon as the user makes a selection, to clearly communicate two things:

We take their privacy very seriously.

Refreshing the page at any point will clear all their information and they will have to start over.

The alert should:

Appear under the Continue button.

Fade smoothly into view when a selection is made.

Not be dismissible (no close icon, no dismiss button).

Use our orange secondary color for its background/border/text styling, consistent with the app’s secondary color system.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – Persistent orange privacy & refresh warning on Selection page

Enhance the /selection page so that:

Trigger behavior

As soon as the user selects any option (Narrative, Response Letter, or Both):

A privacy + refresh warning alert appears, underneath the Continue button.

Once the alert has appeared:

It should remain visible as long as the user stays on the Selection page (even if they change their selection).

It should not be dismissible.

Content & tone

The alert should include messaging along the lines of (you can refine copy slightly, but keep meaning):

“We take your privacy very seriously. If you refresh the page at any point, your information will be cleared and you’ll need to start over.”

Tone must be:

Clear

Reassuring

Honest about the refresh behavior (since we now clear all form data on reload).

Visuals, color, and animation

The alert should:

Use the app’s orange secondary color for its primary styling:

Orange-tinted background

Orange border

Text color that works with the secondary orange (e.g., dark orange or high-contrast text).

Be visually consistent with other secondary/orange elements in the app.

It should fade in smoothly when it first appears:

e.g., transition-opacity duration-300 with opacity-0 → opacity-100.

It should be visually distinct from regular text, but not as “harsh” as an error banner (this is an informative, supportive notice).

Non-dismissible

No “X” or close/dismiss button.

No click-to-hide behavior.

The alert is controlled only by whether the user has made a selection in this visit.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Alert appears after first selection

Given the user has just arrived on the Selection page and has not yet chosen an option

When they select any tool option (Narrative, Response Letter, or Both)

Then:

The Continue button remains where it is.

A new orange alert box appears under the Continue button, with the privacy + refresh warning text.

The alert fades in smoothly (opacity transition).

Scenario: Orange styling and persistence

Given the alert has appeared

When the user looks at the page

Then:

The alert clearly uses the app’s orange secondary color styling (background/border/text) in a way that is readable and consistent with the design system.

The alert remains visible if the user changes their selection or interacts with other page elements.

Scenario: Alert is non-dismissible

Given the alert is visible

When the user clicks anywhere on the alert or elsewhere on the page

Then:

The alert does not close or hide.

There is no close icon or dismiss action.

Scenario: No alert before selection

Given the user has just loaded the Selection page

When they have not yet chosen a tool option

Then:

No alert is visible.

The page appears as it currently does, with only the title, options, and Continue button.

Scenario: Refresh behavior explanation matches app behavior

Given we’ve implemented logic elsewhere so that refreshing anywhere in the app returns the user to Home and clears all data

When the user reads the alert

Then:

The message accurately reflects reality: refreshing will clear their information and they’ll need to start over.

There’s no mismatch between the alert text and actual behavior.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the Selection page implementation

Locate the Selection page component.

Identify:

Where the selection state is stored (which tool is chosen).

Where the Continue button is rendered.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That the alert appears under the Continue button once any selection is made.

That it should fade in using Tailwind transitions.

That it must use the app’s secondary orange color (reuse existing Tailwind classes or custom color tokens for this).

That it must not be dismissible.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

Selection logic and Continue button behavior remain unchanged.

Mobile layout preserves good spacing; the orange alert doesn’t overlap or crowd other elements.

The alert is accessible (readable, good contrast, logical place in DOM).

Propose best-practice UX and styling

Suggest:

Tailwind classes to create an orange info-style alert, e.g.:

border-secondary-orange, bg-secondary-orange/10, text-secondary-orange

Or the actual class names from your Tailwind config for the secondary orange color.

How to implement fade-in with transition-opacity and a hasMadeSelection flag.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Add state like hasMadeSelection on the Selection page.

Step 2: Update the selection handler to set hasMadeSelection to true when the user chooses any option.

Step 3: In JSX:

Render the Continue button as now.

Below it, conditionally render the orange alert when hasMadeSelection is true, with fade-in classes.

Step 4: Ensure no dismiss behavior is added.

Step 5: Manually test:

Page load → no alert.

First selection → orange alert fades in under Continue.

Changing selection → alert stays.

Navigating away and back → alert resets until a new selection is made.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change selection options or their functionality.

Alter routing or form behavior.

Only adjust:

The Selection page’s UI to include the non-dismissible orange alert.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified JSX example (using placeholder class names for the orange secondary color, to be replaced with actual project values):

const [selectedTool, setSelectedTool] = useState(null);
const [hasMadeSelection, setHasMadeSelection] = useState(false);

const handleSelectTool = (tool) => {
  setSelectedTool(tool);
  if (!hasMadeSelection) {
    setHasMadeSelection(true);
  }
};

// ...

<div className="mt-6 space-y-4">
  <Button
    disabled={!selectedTool}
    onClick={handleContinue}
    className="w-full"
  >
    Continue
  </Button>

  {hasMadeSelection && (
    <div
      className="mt-3 rounded-md border px-3 py-2 text-left text-sm transition-opacity duration-300 opacity-100
                 border-secondary-orange bg-secondary-orange/10 text-secondary-orange"
    >
      We take your privacy very seriously. If you refresh the page at any point,
      your information will be cleared and you’ll need to start over.
    </div>
  )}
</div>


Clarify that border-secondary-orange, bg-secondary-orange/10, and text-secondary-orange should map to whatever Tailwind color aliases you already use for your secondary orange.

Do not run e2e tests

For this prompt:

You may update the Selection page and add the alert.

You may do manual or small component-level checks.

Do NOT run or modify end-to-end (e2e) test suites; I will manually verify the behavior.
