Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
On the Home page, we already have:

Hero section

Feature cards (Narratives + Pre-Adverse letter)

How It Works

Safe-space / privacy block

Stories of Change carousel

I want to add a new, short “Is this for me?” strip:

Placed directly below the Stories of Change section on the Home page.

Styled with an orange-accented look (using our existing orange/secondary tokens), but still gentle and non-alarming.

Contains two sub-sections:

“Reframe.me might help if…” (who this is for)

“This is not…” (clear boundaries: not legal advice, no hiring guarantees, not a replacement for professional help).

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may do local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm behavior in the UI.

Business requirement – “Is this for me?” informational strip (orange, with “This is not”)

Add a new section on the Home page that:

Placement:

Appears after the Stories of Change section / carousel.

Appears before the footer and any final content.

Uses the same horizontal padding and max-w-* conventions as other Home sections.

Content:

Main heading, for example:

“Is this for me?” (use exactly this heading text).

A short “This might help if…” subsection, e.g. bullets such as (you can drop in copy like this or close to it):

You’re applying for jobs after a conviction or justice involvement.

You’re worried about what to say when your background comes up in the hiring process.

You’ve received (or are worried about) a pre-adverse action notice and don’t know how to respond.

A clear “This is not…” subheading and bullet list, including points like:

This is not legal advice.

This does not guarantee you will be hired or keep a job.

This is not a replacement for talking with a lawyer, legal aid, or a trusted advisor.

Styling (orange but not alarming):

The section should have a light, warm orange accent that matches your brand (e.g., using your secondary/orange tokens such as border-orange-400/30, bg-orange-500/5, text-orange-400, etc.).

It should feel:

Supportive and warm, not like an error/warning box.

Similar visual weight to Safe-space / FAQ sections, but with orange highlights instead of grey-only.

Suggested ideas (you can adapt to your design system):

A rounded card with a soft orange-tinted background (bg-orange-500/5) and orange border.

An orange label/pill above the heading (e.g., small “Who this is for” tag).

Orange bullet markers or left border line.

Tone:

Gentle, trauma-aware, non-judgmental.

Clear about limits (no legal advice / no guarantees) without scaring the user away.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Section placement under Stories of Change

Given the user scrolls through the Home page

When they pass the Stories of Change section

Then:

They see a new section with the heading “Is this for me?” directly below Stories of Change.

The footer remains below this new section.

Scenario: “Reframe.me might help if…” bullets are present

Given the new section is visible

When the user reads the top content of the section

Then:

They see brief bullets describing situations where Reframe.me might help (e.g., applying after a conviction, worrying about how to talk about a record, responding to pre-adverse action).

The bullets clearly target justice-involved job seekers without shaming.

Scenario: “This is not…” bullets clearly set expectations

Given the user continues reading the section

When they reach the “This is not…” part

Then:

They see a subheading like “This is not:” followed by bullets that state:

This is not legal advice.

This does not guarantee hiring outcomes.

This does not replace talking with a lawyer/legal aid/trusted advisor.

The language is clear and easy to understand.

Scenario: Orange styling is present and not alarming

Given the new section is rendered

When the user visually scans it

Then:

They can see clear orange accents (border, heading, or bullet markers) that match the app’s orange brand color.

The section does not look like an error or urgent warning; it feels like a warm informational callout.

Scenario: No regressions to Stories of Change or other sections

Given the Stories of Change carousel and other Home sections were previously working

When the “Is this for me?” strip is added

Then:

Stories of Change behavior and layout remain unchanged.

Safe-space, How It Works, hero, and footer all still function and layout correctly.

There are no new console errors.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current Home page structure

Identify:

The component/section that renders Stories of Change.

Where the Home page currently transitions from Stories of Change to the footer or next sections.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain that:

You will insert a new, orange-accented “Is this for me?” section between Stories of Change and the footer.

The section will have:

A main heading “Is this for me?”

A short “Reframe.me might help if…” list.

A “This is not:” list clarifying that it’s not legal advice, doesn’t guarantee hiring outcomes, and doesn’t replace professional help.

The styling will use orange accents consistent with existing brand tokens while remaining gentle.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

You keep Home page spacing and responsive layout consistent (same max-w-*, px-*).

The new section doesn’t introduce duplicate content already present in FAQ, but complements it.

The orange styling doesn’t conflict with existing error/alert components (no red/orange confusion).

Propose best-practice implementation details

Suggest a structure like:

<section
  className="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-10"
  aria-labelledby="is-this-for-me-heading"
  data-testid="section-is-this-for-me"

  <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
    <div className="rounded-xl border border-orange-400/30 bg-orange-500/5 p-6 md:p-7">
      <div className="space-y-4">

            Is this for me?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            Reframe.me is designed for people navigating job searches with a past record
            or justice involvement.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div className="space-y-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          <div>
            <p className="font-medium text-orange-400">

              <li>You’ve received (or are worried about) a pre-adverse action notice and don’t know how to respond.</li>

              <li>Legal advice or a substitute for speaking with a lawyer or legal aid.</li>
              <li>A guarantee that you will be hired or keep a job.</li>
              <li>A replacement for your own judgment or support from trusted people in your life.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

</section>


You can adapt exact copy and colors to match your design tokens and tone, but keep:

The two subsections (“might help if” and “This is not”).

The orange accent treatments.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Identify where the Stories of Change section is rendered in the Home page component.

Right after that section, insert the new section for “Is this for me?” using the shared layout patterns (same px, max-w, etc.).

Implement the content structure:

Heading: “Is this for me?”

“Reframe.me might help if…” bullets.

“This is not:” bullets.

Style the container with:

Rounded card, orange-tinted border/background.

Orange text accents for labels/headings.

Muted text for body copy.

Verify on mobile and desktop:

Section appears directly below Stories of Change.

Text wraps nicely and remains readable.

No layout conflicts with surrounding sections.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change Stories of Change content or logic.

Alter the FAQ / Learn More page in this prompt.

Modify hero or How It Works sections.

Only:

Add the new “Is this for me?” section and style it appropriately with orange accents.

For this prompt, remember: no e2e tests. You may perform local/component-level checks only; I’ll verify the UI and copy myself.
