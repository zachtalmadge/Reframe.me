Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The Home page currently includes a “Safe space / privacy” section with a Shield icon and the heading:
“A judgement-free space, built for your reality.”

The card already has some hover behavior and a simple shine, but:

The shine does not yet feel like a realistic “light on gloss” effect.

The effect should be refined to feel more like a specular light sweep across high-gloss text.

The theme of the shine and card accents for this block should be neutral grey/white, not orange.

I want you to:

Make the shine look more like a narrow, bright light streak moving across the text, with soft edges and a subtle specular feel.

Keep the overall effect calm and trauma-aware (no harsh flashing), and keep the color theme for this effect grey/white, not orange.

Important for this change:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
You may perform local/component-level checks only. I will manually confirm the behavior in the UI.

The current safe-space section looks roughly like this:

Business requirement – Glossy, grey-tone shine effect on safe-space text

Update the safe-space / privacy section so that:

The card keeps the same structure and content, but:

Uses an improved, “high-gloss” light sweep on hover, primarily across the heading text:

A narrow, bright, soft-edged streak moves from left to right over the heading when the user hovers/focuses the card.

The streak feels like a spotlight on glossy text, not just a generic overlay.

The shine uses neutral grey/white tones, not orange:

Use white and light-grey alpha gradients (e.g., white / white-80% / transparent) combined with blend modes.

No orange in the shine gradient or card highlight for this section.

The card itself can be slightly refined to feel more “glossy”:

A subtle top inner highlight (light grey/white gradient) when hovered.

A gentle lift + shadow similar to other interactive cards, but with a neutral (grey-ish) feel.

The animation must be:

Short and smooth (around 0.7–1s for the sweep).

Triggered on hover/focus (e.g., group-hover, focus-within).

Non-looping by default (one sweep per hover is enough).

The effect must remain trauma-aware and accessible:

No rapid strobing or intense flashes.

Text remains readable at all times.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion if the app already uses motion-safe / motion-reduce patterns.

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Glossy shine appears on heading with neutral grey/white

Given the user is on the page with the safe-space section

When they hover over or focus the safe-space card

Then:

A single, smooth sweep of light moves from left to right across the heading text.

The streak is bright and narrow, with soft edges, and feels like light reflecting off a glossy surface.

The shine uses white/grey tones, not orange, and blends naturally with the existing text color.

Scenario: Card feels subtly more “glossy” on hover

Given the user moves the pointer over the safe-space card

When the hover state is active

Then:

The card shows a slight lift and shadow consistent with other interactive cards.

An optional, subtle top highlight appears (e.g., a faint white/grey gradient band along the top edge).

The overall look is more “polished” but still calm and not over-the-top.

Scenario: Shine effect is comfortable and motion-safe

Given the user repeatedly hovers in and out of the card

When the shine plays

Then:

Each sweep is smooth, around 0.7–1 second in duration.

There is no rapid flashing or aggressive looping.

If the user’s system is set to reduce motion (and the app uses motion-safe / motion-reduce), the effect is appropriately toned down or disabled in a way consistent with the rest of the app.

Scenario: No changes to content or semantics

Given the existing safe-space section content and semantics

When the glossy shine and hover refinements are added

Then:

The heading text, paragraph text, and bullet list remain exactly the same.

The section still uses <section> with aria-labelledby="safe-space-heading" and <h2> for the heading.

Layout and responsiveness (stacked on mobile, row layout on larger screens) are preserved.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the current hover + shine implementation

Locate the safe-space / privacy section component on the Home page.

Identify any existing hover classes (group, hover:shadow, transition, etc.) and any previous shine-related markup or styles that were already added.

Identify how other interactive cards above this section are implementing:

Hover lift/scale/shadow.

Any subtle highlights or overlays.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

In your own words, explain:

That you will upgrade the shine to feel like a “high-gloss light sweep” across the heading.

That the color palette for the shine should be neutral (grey/white) and avoid orange.

That the card’s hover state can include a subtle top highlight and refined shadow, but the content and structure stay the same.

That the effect must be smooth, short, and non-looping, and respect motion preferences.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure that:

Any new CSS or Tailwind utilities are scoped and do not accidentally affect other components.

The card’s readability is maintained:

Shine uses mix-blend-mode or low-opacity gradients without making the text illegible.

If you add custom utilities (e.g., in globals.css or Tailwind @layer utilities), they use neutral naming and won’t conflict with existing classes.

The safe-space card continues to feel consistent with other components on the page (no wildly different animation style).

Propose best-practice implementation details

Describe how you will implement a reusable “glossy shine” utility:

Add a @keyframes animation (e.g., glossy-shine) that moves a streak from left to right.

Add Tailwind utility classes such as:

.text-glossy-wrapper – relative inline-block overflow-hidden.

.text-glossy-overlay – absolute inset-0 with:

background-image: linear-gradient(120deg, transparent 0%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 30%, rgba(255,255,255,0.85) 50%, rgba(255,255,255,0) 70%, transparent 100%);

mix-blend-mode: screen;

opacity: 0; transform: translateX(-130%); pointer-events: none;

.text-glossy-active – sets opacity: 1 and applies the glossy-shine animation over ~0.9s.

Explain how you will tie this to hover/focus:

Wrap the <h2> in a container with className="text-glossy-wrapper".

Add a span with className="text-glossy-overlay group-hover:motion-safe:text-glossy-active" so the shine plays on hover.

Explain how you’ll keep the theme grey/white:

The gradient and top highlight overlays use white/grey with transparency and no orange.

The card’s border/background may still use chart-2 variables as defined, but the shine itself is neutral.

Assess other best practices

Tailwind:

Implement the shine via @layer utilities in your Tailwind/global CSS, with predictable class names and minimal custom CSS.

Accessibility:

Keep animations smooth and low-intensity; no jittery or abrupt transitions.

Use motion-safe: prefixes where appropriate to respect reduced-motion settings.

UX:

Ensure the card feels inviting and safe, not “flashy.” The user should perceive it as a gently highlighted area of reassurance.

Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Open the file where global styles / Tailwind @layer utilities are defined (e.g., globals.css or similar).

Step 2: Add a @keyframes glossy-shine animation and new utility classes:

.text-glossy-wrapper

.text-glossy-overlay

.text-glossy-active

(Optionally) a utility for the top highlight overlay on the card.

Step 3: Update the safe-space card:

Ensure the outer card div has group and hover classes for lift/shadow (reusing patterns from cards above it).

Wrap the <h2> in a div with text-glossy-wrapper.

Add a span inside that wrapper with text-glossy-overlay and a group-hover:motion-safe:text-glossy-active activation class.

Step 4: Optionally, add a neutral top highlight inside the card (using an absolutely positioned div at the top with a white/grey gradient and group-hover fade-in), ensuring the color is grey/white, not orange.

Step 5: Manually verify:

On hover/focus, the heading shows a smooth, glossy sweep from left to right.

The effect looks neutral and polished (no orange in the shine), and text remains readable.

On mobile and desktop, the layout is preserved and the card still looks good.

Step 6: Confirm that no other components unexpectedly pick up these styles.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change or rewrite the safe-space text copy.

Alter unrelated components or global color tokens.

Introduce orange accents into this shine effect.

Only:

Add the glossy shine utilities and apply them to the safe-space card + heading, keeping the theme grey/white.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example of the CSS utilities and JSX wiring, for example:

/* In globals.css or Tailwind CSS file */
@keyframes glossy-shine {
  0% {
    transform: translateX(-130%);
  }
  100% {
    transform: translateX(130%);
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-glossy-wrapper {
    position: relative;
    display: inline-block;
    overflow: hidden;
  }

  .text-glossy-overlay {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    background-image: linear-gradient(
      120deg,
      transparent 0%,
      rgba(255,255,255,0) 30%,
      rgba(255,255,255,0.85) 50%,
      rgba(255,255,255,0) 70%,
      transparent 100%
    );
    mix-blend-mode: screen;
    opacity: 0;
    pointer-events: none;
    transform: translateX(-130%);
  }

  .text-glossy-active {
    opacity: 1;
    animation: glossy-shine 0.9s ease-out forwards;
  }
}

The final implementation should align class names and patterns with your actual Tailwind setup and animation conventions.
