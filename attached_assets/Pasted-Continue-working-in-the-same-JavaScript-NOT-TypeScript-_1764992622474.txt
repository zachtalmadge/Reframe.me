Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The unified multi-step form is already implemented, including Step 2: Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths, which now have:

LinkedIn-style chip inputs

Helper text telling users to press Enter or tap Add

A functional Add button placed next to the input

I want a small UI refinement:
Instead of the Add button being outside and next to the input, I want a “+ Add” button positioned inside the text input at the right end, similar to an input with an embedded action.
Clicking + Add should behave exactly the same as before—adding the current text as a chip.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
I will manually confirm the change myself.

Business requirement – Embedded “+ Add” button inside input

Update Step 2 for both Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths inputs so that:

Each text input has a “+ Add” button embedded inside the input on the right side, using CSS positioning (e.g., relative wrapper + absolute button).

The input and button should visually appear as a single control:

The text field occupies most of the width.

The + Add button sits inside the right edge with appropriate padding and contrast.

The behavior remains:

Typing and pressing Enter still adds a chip.

Clicking + Add still adds a chip.

The + Add button is disabled when the input is empty or only whitespace.

Existing helper text (e.g., “Type a program and press Enter or tap ‘Add’ to save it.”) remains visible and accurate.

The chip list UI (pills with “x” remove icon) remains unchanged.

This applies independently to:

Rehabilitative Programs chip input

Skills & Strengths chip input

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Rehabilitative Programs input with embedded + Add

Given the user is on Step 2 of the form

When they look at the Rehabilitative Programs field

Then:

They see a single input field with placeholder text (e.g., “Type a program name…”).

Inside the right side of the input, they see a “+ Add” button (or “Add” label with a + icon) visually embedded in the field.

Beneath the field, they still see the helper text:

“Type a program and press Enter or tap ‘Add’ to save it.”

Given the user has typed text into the input

When they click/tap the embedded “+ Add” button

Then:

The text is converted into a chip in the Rehabilitative Programs list.

The input is cleared.

The behavior matches pressing Enter.

Scenario: Skills & Strengths input with embedded + Add

Given the user is on Step 2 and viewing Skills & Strengths

When they look at that field

Then:

They see a similar input with an embedded “+ Add” button at the right end.

They see helper text instructing them to press Enter or tap Add.

Given they type a skill or strength

When they click the embedded “+ Add” button

Then:

The skill/strength becomes a chip.

The input clears.

The behavior matches pressing Enter.

Scenario: Disabled and empty behavior

Given the input is empty or contains only spaces

When the user attempts to tap the embedded “+ Add” button

Then:

The button appears visually disabled (e.g., reduced opacity, no hover state).

No chip is added.

No blank/empty chip is created.

Scenario: Enter key still works

Given the user prefers keyboard input

When they type a program or skill and press Enter

Then:

The item is added as a chip, just as before.

The presence of the embedded “+ Add” button does not interfere with the Enter behavior.

Scenario: Mobile-first layout remains usable

Given the app is being used on a small screen

When the user interacts with these inputs

Then:

The input + embedded button remain readable and tappable.

The button does not overlap the text so much that the user cannot see what they are typing.

Layout stays responsive and consistent with the rest of the form.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and locate relevant code

Identify the components for Step 2 chip inputs (Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths).

Find where the current input and standalone Add button are rendered.

Confirm the shared logic that handles typing, Enter key, and adding chips.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That the existing external Add button should be converted into an embedded button inside the input, on the right side.

That Enter and Add must still both add chips.

That helper text and chip behavior must remain unchanged.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

The container for the input is set to relative, and the embedded button uses absolute positioning inside it (Tailwind-friendly).

There is sufficient right padding (pr-...) on the input so text doesn’t run underneath the button.

The button remains keyboard-focusable and accessible (Tab order correct).

Propose best-practice UX for embedded input action

Styling and spacing of the embedded button (e.g., small pill with + Add, high-contrast text).

Adequate right padding & spacing so user text and button don’t overlap.

Clear hover/focus states for the button, while preserving the input’s appearance.

Assess other best practices

Reuse a common ChipInput component (if present) so both Programs and Skills share the same UI pattern.

Use Tailwind classes for:

relative wrapper

absolute inset-y-0 right-0 flex items-center for the button container

Additional pr- on the <input> to make space for the button

Maintain accessibility:

Clear labels, helper text, and readable contrast for the button.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Locate Step 2 JSX for Programs and Skills chip inputs.

Step 2: Wrap each input in a div with relative positioning.

Step 3: Place the input inside with extra right padding (e.g., pr-16) to make room for the embedded button.

Step 4: Add an absolutely positioned button inside the wrapper at the right end and vertically centered:

Hook its onClick to the same function used when Enter is pressed.

Disable it when the trimmed input is empty.

Step 5: Remove or refactor the previous external Add button so there’s only the embedded one.

Step 6: Manually test:

Typing and pressing Enter to add chips.

Typing and clicking the embedded + Add to add chips.

Empty input behavior.

Mobile and desktop layouts.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change chip rendering, removal behavior, or validation logic beyond the Add button placement.

Modify other steps or unrelated inputs.

Only adjust the layout and positioning of the Add button for the Step 2 chip inputs.

Propose a skeleton framework

Provide a simplified example of what the updated input might look like:

<div className="space-y-1">
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium">
    Rehabilitative Programs
  </label>

  <div className="relative">
    <input
      type="text"
      value={programInput}
      onChange={handleProgramChange}
      onKeyDown={handleProgramKeyDown} // Enter adds chip
      placeholder="Type a program name..."
      className="w-full border rounded-md px-3 py-2 pr-16 text-sm" // extra right padding
    />
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={handleAddProgram}
      disabled={!programInput.trim()}
      className="absolute inset-y-0 right-1 my-auto px-3 text-xs font-medium rounded-md"
    >
      + Add
    </button>
  </div>

  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
    Type a program and press Enter or tap “Add” to save it.
  </p>

  {/* chips render below */}
</div>


Note that a similar pattern should be applied to Skills & Strengths.

Do not modify any files yet

First, output your understanding of this change and your implementation plan.

Remember: do NOT perform any e2e tests for this fix—I will manually confirm it myself.

Wait for my confirmation that your approach is sound before updating the code.
