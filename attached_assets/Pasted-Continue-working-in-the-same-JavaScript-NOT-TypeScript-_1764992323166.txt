Continue working in the same JavaScript (NOT TypeScript) + React + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first project.
The unified multi-step form is already implemented, including Step 2: Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths, which use LinkedIn-style chip inputs.

In Step 2, the fields:

“Rehabilitative Programs”

“Skills & Strengths”

currently require the user to press Enter to add their typed text as a chip.
However:

There is no text telling the user they should press Enter.

There is no visible button in or near the input to signify “Add” behavior.

I want to add both:

Clear text instructions that explain how to add items.

A functional “Add” button in the input area that performs the same action as pressing Enter.

Important for this fix:
For this change, DO NOT perform any end-to-end (e2e) tests or automated full-flow testing.
I will manually confirm the change myself.

Business requirement – Clear add behavior for Programs & Skills chips

Update Step 2 so that both Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths chip inputs:

Show explicit instructions such as:

“Type an item and press Enter or tap ‘Add’ to save it.”

Include a visible, clickable “Add” button integrated with the input (e.g., inside the right side of the input or immediately adjacent).

The Add button:

Performs the same action as pressing Enter:

Takes the current text in the field and converts it into a chip/pill.

Is disabled when the input is empty or only whitespace.

Is enabled when there is valid text to add.

Pressing Enter should still work as before; we are adding affordances, not removing keyboard support.

The existing chip list behavior should remain:

Each added item appears as a pill with its label and an “x” to remove.

Users can add multiple chips in each field.

Removing chips still works as before.

This applies to both input areas independently:

Rehabilitative Programs chip list

Skills & Strengths chip list

Acceptance criteria (Given / When / Then)
Scenario: Instructions visible for Rehabilitative Programs

Given the user is on Step 2 of the multi-step form

When they view the Rehabilitative Programs field

Then:

They see an input with a placeholder like “Type a program name…”

They see helper text near the field (e.g., below it) such as:

“Type a program and press Enter or tap ‘Add’ to save it.”

They see a visible Add button associated with that input.

Scenario: Add button behavior – Rehabilitative Programs

Given the user has typed text into the Rehabilitative Programs input

When they click/tap the Add button

Then:

The text is converted into a chip/pill in the programs list.

The input field is cleared.

The new chip appears alongside any existing chips.

The behavior is equivalent to pressing Enter.

Given the input is empty or contains only whitespace

When they attempt to click the Add button

Then:

The Add button is disabled or has no effect.

No blank chips are created.

Scenario: Instructions & Add button for Skills & Strengths

Given the user is on Step 2 and viewing Skills & Strengths

When they focus that input

Then:

They see similar helper text:

“Type a skill or strength and press Enter or tap ‘Add’ to save it.”

They see an Add button that behaves exactly like the Rehabilitative Programs Add button:

Adds the current input as a chip

Clears the field

Is disabled when the input is empty/invalid.

Scenario: Enter key behavior still works

Given the user prefers keyboard interaction

When they type a program or skill and press Enter

Then:

The item is added as a chip exactly as before.

The new helper text and Add button do not break or change the Enter key behavior.

Scenario: No regressions in Step 2 behavior

Given Step 2 already supports:

Multiple program/skill chips

Removing chips

Progressing to the next step with valid data

When these instruction texts and Add buttons are added

Then:

All existing behavior continues to work.

Only the UX around adding new chips is enhanced.

What I want you (Replit AI) to do

Assess the enhancement and identify relevant code

Locate the component(s) responsible for Step 2 of the form.

Identify the reusable chip-input logic used for Rehabilitative Programs and Skills & Strengths:

Where the Enter key is currently handled to add a chip.

How the chips array is stored in state.

Describe your understanding of the requirements

Explain in your own words:

That each chip input must now show helper text explaining “press Enter or tap ‘Add’”.

That a visible Add button must be added and wired to the same logic as pressing Enter.

That the Enter key behavior remains fully supported.

Identify key considerations to avoid disrupting existing functionality

Ensure:

The design stays mobile-first; the input + Add button should remain easy to tap on small screens.

Tailwind layout doesn’t cause wrapping or misalignment of the input and Add button.

The Add button is clearly associated with the correct input field (programs vs skills) and doesn’t mix state between them.

Propose best-practice UX for the updated inputs

Placement of helper text (e.g., below the input, small font, muted color).

Design of the Add button (e.g., icon plus text or just text like “Add”, with clear focus states).

Button enabled/disabled feedback (e.g., opacity or cursor changes when disabled).

Assess other best practices

Reuse a common ChipInput component if it already exists (props for label, placeholder, helperText).

Keep accessibility in mind:

Inputs labeled clearly.

Add button reachable via keyboard (Tab order).

Screen reader instructions reflect both Enter and Add button behavior.

Generate a step-by-step implementation plan

At a minimum include:

Step 1: Locate Step 2’s chip inputs (programs and skills).

Step 2: Add helper/instruction text for each input, using simple text components and Tailwind classes.

Step 3: Add a visible Add button adjacent to or inside each input:

Hook it into the same function that runs when Enter is pressed.

Ensure it respects empty/whitespace validation.

Step 4: Manually test in the running app:

Type and press Enter to add items.

Type and click Add to add items.

Verify chips appear and can be removed as before.

Verify Add is disabled when the input is empty.

Keep the scope limited

Do not:

Change other fields in Step 2 or other steps of the form.

Modify validation rules beyond what’s necessary to prevent blank chips.

Only enhance the Programs and Skills & Strengths chip inputs with helper text and an Add button.

Propose a skeleton framework

Show a simplified example of how a chip input might look after the change, for example:

<div className="space-y-1">
  <label className="block text-sm font-medium">
    Rehabilitative Programs
  </label>
  <div className="flex gap-2">
    <input
      type="text"
      value={programInput}
      onChange={handleProgramChange}
      onKeyDown={handleProgramKeyDown} // Enter adds chip
      placeholder="Type a program name..."
      className="flex-1 border rounded-md px-3 py-2 text-sm"
    />
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={handleAddProgram}
      disabled={!programInput.trim()}
      className="px-3 py-2 text-sm font-medium rounded-md"
    >
      Add
    </button>
  </div>
  <p className="text-xs text-gray-500">
    Type a program and press Enter or tap “Add” to save it.
  </p>
  {/* chips render below */}
</div>


Clarify that a similar pattern should be applied to Skills & Strengths.

Remember: do NOT perform any e2e tests for this fix—I will manually confirm it myself.

Wait for my confirmation that your approach is sound before updating the code.
